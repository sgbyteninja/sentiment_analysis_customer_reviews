"The Westin Kierland is a beautiful resort located in PHOENIX, not Scottsdale. 

Some close friends of mine from Canada stayed in this PHOENIX resort for a few days, so I've hung out in its rooms and generally lounged about the property. The rooms were impressive, beautifully decorated, and spacious. We especially enjoyed taking the kids out to small fire pits maintained on the grounds, where guests to our fine city of PHOENIX can roast marshmallows. 

The Kierland has some tough competition, considering that the city of PHOENIX has every one of the most famous resorts in the Valley, from the Biltmore, to the Phoenician to the Royal Palms. It does pretty well in a tough line-up. No offense to Scottsdale, which also has some great resorts such as the Four Seasons. It's just that the most famous ones are in PHOENIX.

Love this place! I think this is probably the best Chinese buffet out here! They serve quality gourmet food. And they have a full bar too. Place is clean and service is great. Would go back anytime!,1
"Am I missing something here? I've actually been back to America's. Twice after my first visit, convinced that I had accidentally gone to the wrong America's or perhaps stumbled into a nearby taco shop on 7th. 

Alas, the helpful Yelp photo informs me that I have, in fact, now eaten three times at the Famous America's Taco Shop.

I can't emphasize how incredibly average and underwhelming the fare here is. See, I'm a burrito man, myself. I don't claim to know Mexican food or it's various subgenres, but I did live in San Diego for three years and I've definitely had what I would call over-the-top, blow your socks out your a** good Mexican food. The same can be said for any number of burritos. 

America's, I'm sorry to say it, but neither your tacos nor your burritos live up to the incredible hype that now surrounds you (although, the salsa was really, really good).

I'm still on my quest for the Best Burrito in Maricopa County, I'll let you know when I find it fellow yelpers.",2
"I stumbled across this place after missing my usual Light Rail stop on my way to pick up a Zipcar at the downtown ASU campus.

First I tried my usual caffeine fix...a nonfat double latte. Excellent.

Second trip back, I gave the breakfast burrito (plus bacon) a try. Delicious. The tortilla was as good as everything inside.

Third trip, a beet salad and a bacon chocolate chip cookie. Bacon and chocolate for the win!

I've been here three times and have not been disappointed. The decor is modest, but functional, as it should be at a good business with honestly good food. The barista is not only knowledgable and skilled, but is also a genuine sweetheart.

It's just a couple of blocks from the Jefferson and First Street Light Rail stop (East bound), so I've been stopping by on my way to work.",1
"One bite and I was transported back to the crowded streets of Monterrey.  I could almost smell the exhaust of the vochos and hear the distant conversation of the local policia extorting their prescribed mordida.  Quite simply, this is the taco as the way it was intended by its creators.  The pure and unadulterated classic enjoyed by the Mexican working class.

What Pomo is to pizza, this place is to tacos.  Authentic...absolutely authentic.",1
"I really enjoy That's A Wrap... all of the food I've ordered here has been really enjoyable, plus it's all a really good value for the money. My favorite wrap here is the Prince of Thai, sin pollo con tofu. The Veggie Bowl is also another good option and I'm pleased they can make anything vegetarian. Worth a stop for lunch, however, the parking lot is tight and I have been here more than once when it was full.",1
"It was ok, there was a large group of us and we all enjoyed the appitizers, including the table side guac.  Biggest complaint was how poorly their bar was stocked.  No Chivas, no Sambuca, weak margaritas, etc.  So while the service was good, the food was just ok and the bar needs to be stocked better.  There is room for improvement.",0
"i love mac n' cheese & i love the dark.  
these 2 facts make me like this place.
 
the service was good. the prices were reasonable. they had a decent selection of craft beer & local wine. the dark colors and candles were comforting.  (however this atmosphere makes the headlights from the cars parking up against the windows somewhat more obtrusive)

a solid 3 stars for me.. i wasn't blown away, but i wasn't disappointed.

p.s. i think maybe i'll miss lisa g's..?!",0
"This was the perfect lunch! I got the Sack's Symphony with turkey, bacon, avocado, sprouts, tomato and cream cheese. It was SO SO good. The combination was prefect. There was plenty of meat and toppings piled on- it definitely filled me up. It's clear the place is a well-loved lunch spot- it was a full house at 1:00. I can't wait to go back.",1
"3.5 stars. 

We decided to check this place out after all the waves. The space and decor is nice and cute, and girly! We arrived at 10:30 for a Sunday brunch, and there were plentiful of empty seats for us to choose. Nice patio, too!

I had the French Toast with fresh strawberries and chicken apple sausage (however, the menu says with raspberry, I didn't really care for either one, meh~) The toasts were thick and soft, but weren't that outstanding. I really liked the chicken apple sausages on the other hand, they were tasty and not the typical greasy kind. Friend had the Spinach and Tomato Omelette with feta cheese. I didn't take a bite, but she really enjoyed it. It came with a side of potatoes and fresh fruits.  

Our waitress was nice, but the service was slow... Overall we had a nice little trip. It's definitely a good spot for a girls' day out!",0
"If you are staying in Phoenix for any length of time, this is a must stop for at least a cocktail.  From walking through the kitchen, to being seated promptly in a booth, this is quintessential gastronomic delight.  Durant's is an icon and legend. Period.  Wine list is great, have a well-versed sommelier also.  I never order Filet, but when in Rome...",1
"Friendly reps, painfully high tire price quote.  Found em for $100 less, per tire while waiting for my car to be pulled up.",0
"I think Marcellino's will get a second chance for a special occasion.  I visited the restaurant based on seeing it on Check Please Arizona.  The food is obviously made fresh and was excellent but I felt a little overpriced based on other excellent restaurants in the area.  Although the atmosphere was romantic, I had a hard time reading the menu and the bill using just the votive candle on the table.  There has to be a better way!",0
"Not too shabby. Decent drinks, cheese/meat plate was standard but good. The beet salad didn't have many beets on it.. more lettuce. I think we were wanting it to be all beets. The highlight of the whole dinner was the squishy bread that came with the cheese plate. Pizza was also good. Big negative was that all 4 pizzas were soggy in the center. Other than that, no complaints. The one with fruit on it was the best. The sausage was typical, but good, the margarita didn't seem to be a winner with the table, I thought it was good. I like that rubbery cheese thing though.. The one with seafood on it was my least favorite.The tiramisu with pine nut brittle was tasty, the chocolate cake was fine.",1
"I walked int0 Arizona Art Supply and fell in love.  I moved downtown 2 years ago, and I've never quite gotten my craft room up and running.  But I had a particular project in mind, and stopped by the shop on a weekend for some spray adhesive.

I struggled to find a place to lock up my bike.  They lose a star for this, as everyone does in my world.  Ended up locking to a sign in the middle of the parking lot.

Once inside, I was dazzled by the available materials.  I hadn't been in an art store for a year.  To make matters even better, they were playing the soundtrack from Amelie, and the cashier was a handsome tattooed young man.

I will regularly visit for inspiration and supplies.  This place is a treasure.",1
"The first time I went to YC's was in scottsdale. I loved how you choose what you like in your bowl and sauces. they cook it up right in front of you. you can stuff your bowl as much as you can. don't worry about getting alot because all you pay for a take out box is 50 cents. it is great for leftovers, the food tastes fresh still. The one in tempe was awesome as well. I love this place. I had one larg bowl, a bowl of rice, chicken soup, and a soda for $10.25 how can you go wrong with that???",1
"Lacking a clean or acceptable Chinese restaurant in Casa Grande, I discovered this jewel while showing homes in Anthem. Menu has many choices and restaurant is clean with attractive decor. The dishes I have chosen so far have been excellent with nice portions. Service is friendly and efficient. Well worth the drive from anywhere in Pinal County!!!",1
"I recently tried vietnamese food, maybe 3 years ago.  I especially like the pho soup and spring rolls.  Since then, I have been trying every place I can that serves pho.  Out of every place that I have been so far, this place is always the one I come back to.  It's a little hole in the wall type place.  The kind you would drive by and never even notice if you weren't looking for it.  The pho has some of the best tasting broth and is a good portion.  It's about average price if not closer to the cheapest I have found.  It comes with a good sized plate of sprouts, basil, mint, lime, and jalapeno.  The spring rolls that I get have pork and shrimp in them and are a pretty good size.  The peanut sauce that comes with them for dipping tastes almost like fresh made peanut butter and has fresh ground pieces of peanut in it.  The service is fairly quick and very friendly, even with the fact that there is some language barrier.  I was actually taken to this place for the first time by an ex-coworker of mine who is an old vietnamese guy.  He told me himself that this is probably the best place he has found to eat pho at, and based on the fact that it is usually packed with asian people during lunch time, I am very inclined to believe him.",1
"The valet guys were absolutely awesome.  They were the best part of my stay at this hotel.  

The grounds were okay - NOT 5 star quality.  The decor in the rooms seemed old, and the color scheme was dated. 

Although most of the staff was friendly, we did have a pretty bad encounter with the pool manager.  My husband and I had bought a bag of popcorn at the grocery store and were snacking on it poolside.  The pool manager came up to us and informed us that outside food is not allowed in the pool area.  She told us that we needed to put our food away.  She then left without even offering the opportunity to order some Fairmont approved food.  It was really strange and off-putting.  We had been sitting by the pool for over an hour and not a single person from the wait staff had come up to us to take our drink/food orders.  Also, it seems a bit ridiculous that we can't eat our own bagged popcorn.  It's not like we were chowing down on a big meal and making a mess.  It made the resort seem elitist.  I definitely won't be staying here again.

I've stayed at the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale before and would definitely recommend that hotel over the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess.",2
"No question -- my FAVORITE burger in the valley!

I first got turned on to Lobbys at a Yelp Office Hours -- http://www.yelp.com/biz/september-office-hours-at-lobbys-tempe#hrid:kQOElzgklMRbAyWS8LhVFw - - and by my check-ins, you can see i've frequented there since. 

I've tried a lot of other ""great"" burgers -- 5 Guys, Smashburger, etc - but IMHO, none of them stack up to the food and the experience at Lobbys. 

The burgers at Lobbys are so good that I crave them --I want to drive across town or plan out my day so that I'm in the area to get one! I just feel that there's more quality ingredients with a Lobbys burger -- the bun, the taste, the way the cheese melts over the whole patty, the special sauce, and the burger itself. 

And just as Lynn W says the service is truly superior here and "" He (Lobby) really cares about his business and it shows"". 

I've recommended many friends to check out Lobbys and have brought a few friends here -- everyone has loved it! Especially my Chicago friends that live in the valley. 

Lobbys burgers is that raised bar that I measure all other burger joints to.",1
"I am totally baffled why this place gets such good reviews. I have been there a few times because it's close to my work and I received some gift certificates for my birthday. Unfortunately after the last experience, I can't go back.  Although they are very nice and have great prices, I have to reveal the ugly truth: 
1. They don't put any effort into sanitizing the tools or the pedicure bowl. I actually saw them clean the brushes and tools in the water I was soaking my feet in and then just rinse out the bowl after they were done... not spray, soap, nothing!
2. Reason #1 probably explains why my heals cracked so severely after my pedicure that they began to bleed.  I had to use peroxide, neosprin, and bandages for almost a week to get it heal. 
3. They water down their nail polish... so much that it destroys the bond and polish never actually dries. 
I hate to bash a business with good customer service, but these practices are simply unacceptable.  I obviously won't be back. =(",2
"Someone already commented on the large Cow mural, I was not going to because it might just be me, but I have heard a few comments about it now. Yea, really odd choice, and kind of uncomfortable to be eating a burger and having Elsa the Cow, with very sad eyes, staring at you while your biting into one of her relatives. Other then that, I feel that they did a good job on the decor. Really nice in fact. 
Now I ordered the Zin Burger, and it was very good. I mean as I was eating it, it was as good as any burger that I have had. As good as Gallo Blanco, and Hula's. Very juicy, flavorful, I liked the bun. It was a 5 star until I stopped eating it. Yep, then it lost a star. How? After I was done, my mouth turned into the Salton Sea. Holy crap, easy on the sodium chef!!! Way too much salt. Now I know what salt does, but overkill. I actually tasted salt for the next hour.  You had me with everything else, just don' t want to feel that I just sucked on a pretzel. 

Only other complaint is the pricing. Like everyone else on here, I think the pricing is all wrong. Especially if your going solo. I mean as a single diner I have to order a basket of fries? I thought Delux was stupid for doing so, why make the same bad move. I also saw most people sharing a burger. If thats not a sign, when customers have to get creative on how to eat at your place without breaking the bank, take a good hard look at how you might make your customers more happy. 
Look at it this way Fox team.
             Zin Burger                                  10.00

"Bike cabs beware! You've got nothing on this rig! 

Tour de Tavern is a tribute to tipsy teamwork and a perfect way to host a unique group event. As ""pedalers"" on their inaugural tour, we enjoyed the celebrity treatment of cruising down the winding streets of Old Town Scottsdale as onlookers snapped photos and cheered us on!

We rocked out to top 40 hits and, by special request, our Lonely Island favorites on their awesome sound system. Our guides were flexible and let our party run the show. If we needed more time for let's say...... an impromptu horseback ride in front of Shotgun Betty's, they were more than happy to wait. 

As an added bonus everyone gets to burn off some of those unwanted cocktail calories in between your favorite watering holes. If you are concerned that after a few stops (and a few shots) your legs might lose some of that forward momentum, there are a few coveted ""non pedaling"" seats in the back of the bike. We all compromised with a friendly and fair rotation system. 

Our tour guides were helpful, accommodating, and entertaining. They even proved to be exceedingly patient upon discovering that we did in facts have ""that guy"" in our group. 

If you're saying to yourself,  ""Such a marvelous experience could only cost an arm and least the majority of a leg"" then you would be wrong! With the cost of gas being substituted for sheer earth friendly man power, our group of fifteen people spent less than $30 bucks each for the experience.

But wait, there's more! Included in this price are all the amazing special deals that Tour de Tavern exclusively brings you at select bars along the route. On our tour we were offered drinks specials ranging from $3 to ONE PENNY!  I say this in all caps because it's ONE PENNY!

So next time you are planning an event, I recommend Tour de Tavern 100%!

""Look Ma! No hands!""",1
"I had a craving for Mexican- American type food, and since there is no longer a Chi-chi's around my friend suggested we go here since I was visiting the area from out of town. She is a frequent diner here, and loves it.  I really enjoyed my experience as well. 
I love a great Chimichanga along with  re-fried beans and ordered a much  needed strawberry  Margareta.  So lovely!!!! I enjoyed everything on my plate!

 I Loved it so much I suggested we come back my last night in town for drinks and appetizers.
We decided to order the  Mini Chimi Sampler, Macayo's Famous Cheese Crisp that I ordered with ground beef (it almost looked like a cheese crisp pizza),Guacamole Dip with chips. They also offer free salsa and chips every time you arrive.
Like my friend- I would be a regular here. I know when I visit my friend that she and I will go back- at my suggestion and to  her delight!",1
"I was very disappointed my last experience at Sauce. I ordered a spinach and apple salad with chicken. I think the apples were from a few days ago wtih no taste and the shredded chicken must have been in the freezer and put on the salad.
The kids however did enjoy their mac and cheese.
The salad was terrible!",2
"Great food, great atmosphere.  Look for the grafetti out back.  Not ""Mexican food,"" but Mexico City cuisine.",1
"Mill Ave has been missing a good breakfast nook, and it has made me very sad. Until now! The atmosphere is very modern. The color scheme is gray, orange, and black and boy do they stick to it, down to the orange frosted cupcakes. Impressive. I had the best french toast I have ever had in my life right here at NCounter. I have only eaten here once, and usually I don't give five stars out after the first visit, but this place is THAT good. So happy to have such a fabulous breakfast restaurant so close to home.",1
"Went for dinner before a Suns game on a Tuesday, got there at 5 and got right in, but the place filled up fast after us.  The atmosphere is awesome, a little brick house split into small rooms with a huge patio dining area.  The service was quality over all.  Very attentive at the beginning, forgot about us throughout the meal but showed up again at the check/dessert time.  We had the Burrata with proscuitto for an app., which was awesome, melt in your mouth, almost sweet cheese, and the proscuitto was like pork butter, lovely.  The pizzas were good but not what i expected when i hear thin crust.  The ingredients were definately quality but the crust was a little fluffy and chewy for my taste.  Bianco still tops the charts on pizza, but for the lack of wait, and quality of food, ambiance, and service i would definately recommend Cibo.  I plan on going back to try some more selections.",1
"The place to go during spring training after a game and see a baseball player (will be crowded for sure). the experience is just really neat though, the place is covered head to toe with sports memorabilia, definitely the place to go if you're a visiting sports fan in scottsdale",1
"What a restaurant! Absolutely loved my experience at Tarbells. I've been hearing rave reviews for quite sometime and decided to try it out recently. My party and I sat at the bar, which was a great choice because the bar was comfortable, rather large and really social and fun. The bartender (young woman) was fabulous, inviting and very nice! She was very attentive. A guest in my party dines at Tarbells often and she had his drink in front of him by the time we walked to the end of the bar.....Now thats some customer service for ya!

Food = We started with the Calamari. A favorite dish of mine and this one was outstanding. Two very different but delicious dipping sauces. A roasted red pepper and a pesto mix. Not sure which one I liked more :) I enjoyed the pan-seared jumbo sea scallops. TO DIE FOR. I am a huge scallop fan and these were done just right. Caramelized, giving them the right amount a sweet....and it was served over very yummy risotto. Another dish enjoyed by my party was the Fennel Sausage Pasta dish, the fennel sausage was AMAZING. 

Overall experience was fantastic, as soon as I get another opportunity I will be dining here again! :)",1
"I love love LOVE this place. My boss (who is into healthy eating) recommended this place. I went over with some highly skeptical friends and one dinner was enough to convert them into believers! The food here is so good! We had the Shrimp dumplings and the Onion tart as starters. We ordered the Shirataki noodles and street tacos as entrees. So also ordered the Kale-aid. All of the dishes were yummy. 
I have gone back many times since then and have never been disappointed! I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad. I always have to get the Kale aid. 
Once, a guy at the next table, uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date! Ever since, I have very careful not to throw my arms around as I can be quite clumsy sometimes! I do NOT want to be banned from my favorite place for my clumsiness! I don't think I can live without True Food!",1
Well I liked this place it smokes it's main rival Hooters. The food is much better more  screen TV's and the girls are much better looking. What else can you say.,1
"I love my eye doctor!  Platonically, of course.  The entire staff is relaxed, friendly, easy going, and personable.  No one ever makes you feel rushed but instead take time to make sure that everything is okay, that you've thought of everything, gotten all of your questions answered, and had plenty of time to make decisions and think.  The doctor takes time to get to know you and to talk about how you use your eyes (staring at the computer, sports, etc).  The assistants try to think of things from your point of view so they can volunteer useful information and ask a lot of specific questions while doing so.  This place treats you like family.  There's a broad range of styles, but mostly, they're fashionable frames.  When I go in, I see a lot of kids, young adults, and 20 and 30-somethings as well as the older patients who so often come to need glasses.  Horwitz costs a little more than the mall chains, but my prescriptions have been consistently better thanks to the doctor taking time, the lenses are much higher quality, and the frames are worlds better in terms of availability of things that aren't ugly and durability.",1
"Covet is an excellent clothing store.
In Arizona, there is almost nowhere decent to shop. 
unless of course you loooooove Juicy Couture, in the event of which, you should probably not even bother reading this review, because this kind of fashion forward clothing won't appeal to you. 

Acne Jeans? check.
Endovenera? check.
Ksubi? check. 
Nike? check. 

Covet starts off with an excellent men's shoe section, 
continues with an excellent men's clothing selection, 
and finishes off with excellent women's wear. 

It really is a shame if you haven't been to Covet yet. Do yourself a  serious favor and support a small business at the same time.",1
"Handmade, in-store fine candies aand chocolates are awesome (way better than See's, but higher priced).  The owners are really great people!",1
"I was taken here while visiting from Chicago and had one of the best margaritas of my life.  I tried the house (on ice with salt) and it was fantastic, but what I couldn't get enough of was the strawberry-lime one.  I couldn't taste a drop of alcohol...and that's when you know you have a good mixed drink on your hands. I honestly could have had three more it was so tasty, but my childlike tolerance for boozin did not allow it.  

The bartender was super nice and friendly, we had many refills of the chips and salsa (damn you, I can never resist), and it was all in a southwestern chill environment.  Supposedly the tacos are top-notch, I will have to give them a whirl next time I'm in town.  

I highly suggest going here for a happy hour or dinner.",1
"I had seen these around before but never stopped in. Started with a drink menu and was quite happy. Good selection of Margaritas and others. The dinner menu was good as well. Drinks were excellent and food was tasty.

I'll make a return trip if for nothing more than a drink. A-OK.",0
"The Original Burrito Co. is quickly becoming my favorite burrito place. The owner came to eat at the restaurant I work at and she told me to come by and try this place out and being a huge fan of Mexican food I had to go. The burritos are really huge and really well priced. I love the California burrito with Chicken, add guacamole. The chicken is so moist and tender. I have tried the carne asada as well, but when I got it it was full of cilantro and jalapenos, which were just overbearing, but I'm thinking it could have been a bad day and will have to try it again. Downside for me would be that the salsa is not spicy at all. It tastes very good, but I am a huge fan of spicy, especially on Mexican food, and its a bummer for me when a place does not offer a very spicy salsa.",1
"While I am giving this restaurant four stars, I must start off by noting that the pizza here is mediocre.  If you want spectacular pizza in Phoenix, don't kid yourself that it's at I-17 and Thomas.  It's over at Pizzeria Bianco.

However, the other items on the dinner menu are worthy of a visit to the 'hood.   The Penne alla Vodka ($12.95) offers up pasta in tomato sauce with bacon, fresh basil cream and vodka.  It is an excellent starter to split with a dining companion and that's exactly what the BF and I do every time we visit this place.  The Cozze Posolipo mussels in garlic white wine sauce ($11.95) are also quite tasty as an appetizer.  The complimentary warm pizza dough they serve with an onion and olive topping is a nice touch.  For entrees, the Pollo Parmigiana ($14.95) is the classic breaded chicken breast with marinara, mozzarella and parmesan cheese served with penne.  The Lasagna della Casa with Bolognese sauce ($13.95) is very good, but the portion is a bit stingy for the price.  The BF often enjoys the Gamberi alla Pana ($15.95) that includes jumbo shrimp sautéed with mushrooms in a brandy cream sauce over a bed of fettuccine.  Please note that the brandy cream sauce is extremely rich.  Another tasty option is the Spaghetti con Salsiccia ($13.95) with mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and Italian sausage in marinara sauce with a touch of white wine.  The Cheese Ravioli ($13.95) is another great choice with the tomato cream sauce.  For dessert, be sure to order a Cannoli Siciliani ($5.95) as it's the very best I have had in Phoenix.  The Tiramisu ($5.95) is good as well.

The bad news is that this place is no longer BYOB.  For whatever reason, the management decided that a restaurant that seats no more than 20 needed a full liquor license.  I really hope that the investment in that spendy license doesn't lead to the undoing of this place.  Given that they don't even have a bar area and I almost never see anyone order a mixed drink, I think staying BYOB might have been a better choice for this neighborhood joint.

The service at this place is also part of the show.  The waiter may well be manic as he will either be way up or way down for your visit.  The décor here is pleasant enough given the location of this tiny restaurant in a modest strip mall.  If you happen to need a trip to the restroom, you will get the chance to traipse through the kitchen.

All in all, Pizza A Metro is ironically a great option for everything but pizza.",1
"3.5 stars. Went to the Calo Flamenco show this past Sunday, brilliantly talented company of dancers and musicians.

The Center just completed a year-long renovation this May, completely refurbished all 1,500+ seats, added guardrails and orchestra level handicap-accessible seating, and enhanced their central A/C system. 

The Chandler Symphony offers free concerts on monthly basis. The Center's programming schedule can be found here:

"""Fuck you all, we hope you die.
That's the Trojan Battle Cry!""
Wow, I can not believe someone Yelp'ed PV. 
 My freshman year, my science teacher was arrested from embezzling from the strip joint she owned. We then had a different teacher every couple of weeks for the first half of the year. When we finally got a permanent teacher, the damage was done. The kids had no connection or respect for any teacher who walked in the door anymore.
  The year I graduated, there were 3000 students and over 1000 in my graduating class. We often had 40+ kids in one classroom. 
Man, I hated this school. When I first started on the Bell Rd Campus, we referred to it as PV Prison because of the tall, iron, spiked gates and security in golf carts patrolling the campus for potential escapees. I remember, before they briefly closed the campus for renovations, a girl falling through the auditorium wall, and pieces of the ceiling falling on peoples heads before they condemned it. After 2 years at this location, they suddenly closed the campus and opened the new campus on Union Hills, the campus that was to become North Canyon.
 They built the new campus with the intention of having both schools open, but as more and more buildings kept falling apart, they decided to shut down PV and re-open it under the same name on the new campus. 
 They spent a shit-ton fuck load of money on a super high-tech theater, in return for letting it be used for official Gov't events,  that no one new how to use. This was one of the best things about it. I was one of the few people who could run the sound and lights and got out of class frequently because of it. 
 I remember making a video with Casey about an art show the school was having and not being allowed to air it on the morning video announcements because we used the phrase ""come out of the closet"" and they thought the phrase might be offensive. Then, that same week, the football team had a video where they all pretended to be gay, talking with lisps and flailing limp wrists. When I went to the office to ask what the fuck, they told me that football players didn't need approval for anything they did. I remember my friend being expelled for missing too much school due to chicken pox and a mother not well enough to call her in. I, of course, seemed invisible to the system. I ditched class often, and it never showed on my record at all. I remember when Miss Lee dressed as a hard rocker with tattoo's for halloween and the administrators making her change it because the costume was a bad influence. I remember my friends boyfriend being suspended because they searched his car for drugs (on an anonymous tip) and found a box cutter in his trunk he used for work which he kept in his trunk because he went to work straight from school.  I remember testing out of highschool classes before freshman year, yet being subjected to 4 years of bullshit. I am pretty sure it was PVUSD that was the inspiration for the movie ""Pump Up the Volume"", which was filmed in the general area.
  When I quit the softball team, the coach/school councilor kept sending people to pull me out of class to try to talk me into playing again. When we took pictures for the badminton team, we didn't have enough uniforms for the entire team. 
 I felt like I was in some prison or some high security mental facility. In fact, when my mom visited the new campus, she was horrified there were no windows and they used the drab, grey/blue colors they use in mental hospitals she had worked in to keep the patients calm. I never had a chemistry class. My two history classes consisted of a teacher who spent one entire year talking about Shakespear, and another who said that ""The slaves did not have it so bad"".  My Biology book was so old, it had my friends mothers name in it from 20 years earlier, AND same friends mother warned me against my Biology teacher, Mr. H__. ""If he ever tells you to stay after class by yourself.. DON'T.""  
 
The Good Things I Remember -
 Mrs. Toal [sp?], a very good, and supportive, English teacher. Miss Lee, the best photography/video teacher ever and always had the best Halloween costumes. Hanging out at lunch under a tree with the boy we called Rico Suave who said he lived in a box and would tell stories about the Horny Lady. Sneaking off campus to go to Barrows Pizza. My friends  wearing cut out Trojan condom boxes pinned to their shirt at the forced ""spirit assemblies"" and chanting our own spirit chant of ""Fuck you all we hope you die, that's the Trojan battle cry"".

 Time has a way of blurring the past, and making it less icky. Yet, my sister is a teacher at North Canyon, and a few years back I went and visited her on campus. The second I stepped into the main building, I felt sick to my stomach. Literally. 
 I hear they have made improvements since I graduated, and I hope so. I don't want my niece and nephew forced to survive another drone factory.",2
"I cannot believe all these negative reviews. 

First I'd like to start with the prices. Don't get me wrong, I love a good deal, BUT, if you are going to complain about how jobs in America are moving to China and India and not shop at AA because of their prices, then you are a hypocrite. AA supports US jobs and their factory is here in the states where they actually care about ethics and their employees. And, they have sales too, I have been in this store more than a few times and seen 30% - 50% off sale signs. And, on their website you can shop the sale section and save up to 75% if not more.

To the clothes - I understand some people may be weirded out and flash back into the 80's when they see the clothes here, as I have read from the reviews on here, BUT, these clothes are actually very stylish and a simple top with a simple pencil skirt  from AA and with some accessories you have a fab outfit. If you are looking for something not so simple try a white strapless romper with their petticoat skirt, add some accessories, and your done. 

The sizes - I am size 4-6 with curves, and the clothes from here fit me fine. I can understand the frustration if you are a little bigger and have had a hard time fitting into the clothes from AA. But, the good thing is that AA is now coming with XL sizes in some of their clothing. 

The models - I love the fact that the models are real and barefaced. As someone who has struggled with a skin condition, I always hate walking around the mall only to see photoshopped perfect faces surrounding me. I always feel comfortable when I walk into AA.

This store - I have never had a bad experience. Always a good one. i like the store, the employees have always been nice to me, I have no complains.",1
"Bought a great pair of their 'eddie' ballet flats here on sale...deal. This store gives good...customer service that is. They noticed my sunglass case was a little too old and gave me a new one of theirs...lovely. I returned a few weeks later during their friends and family night and purchase a different color of the same shoe...perfect for traveling and the lovely shaded purples ones will be a great pop of color with my comfy and neutral travel clothes!

Hey if you see that girl walking by the Seine in Paris with the purple shoes...it's me!",1
"LOVE it here. I stay at hotels about 80 nights a year for work, and often go to Phoenix. Gotta say, if it weren't for the ""hood"" neighborhood, I would've given it 5 stars. The restaurant next door, Bobby Q, has rave reviews, so it seems like a convenient place to eat, but that seems to be the only dinner place around. Good thing it's the Residence Inn, with a small kitchenette.

This is probably the cleanest hotel I've stayed in all year. The dishes and silver wear are very clean and housekeeping keeps it that way daily. I've stayed at places twice the amount of this Residence Inn in Scottsdale and dishes in the kitchenette were filthy. 

Small workout room but you can go to the LA Fitness down the street for free.  Oh, they don't skimp on breakfast-waffles, eggs, sausage, yogurt, fresh fruit and hot and cold cereal. 

Beds don't look comfy but they are Devine.  I had some of my best nights sleep here. It's nice to stay at a place that is more like a home than a hotel.",1
"Their Chicken Critter Salad's got game. More portion of chicken than any other chicken salad I've ordered elsewhere.  They have other great entrees, but this cowpoke likes his critters",1
"We had fun but it is definately more for kids 5 and younger . 
The pretend store was fun and we all had a blast playing in the noodles.",0
My favorite place in the world to eat! Great service and awesome food!,1
"Melrose Pharmacy is my go-to pharmacy.  Not only is it in my neighborhood, it is independently owned and operated by Teresa Stickler.  Her and her husband Kurt are people who care about the community.  The fact that they provide a level of service that their chain store competitors can only dream of is a is the icing on the cake.  They are also lightening quick, dispensing most prescriptions while you wait.

Moreover, they are a FULL  service pharmacy, they also offer delivery (handy when you feel like you are on the verge of death) and useful recommendations on the pros and cons on a on non-prescription drugs and vitamins (often recommending the lower priced generic brand).  In addition, you can find a wide variety of homeopathic products, as well as a selection of snacks, books and small gifts.

Even if you don't need to get a prescription filled, it's worth a visit to check out the retro interior and grab and grab a vintage bottled pop and candy.  Better yet, stop by on a First Friday when the pharmacy features live music, and frequent art shows in the studio in the same complex.",1
"I tired they chicken smash burger.... WOOHOO!!!  LOVE IT!  Crispy chicken (not too think, not too thick) but perfectly crispy.  I ordered the build your own:  Egg bun, crispy chicken, mayo, and swiss cheese.  HELLO MAMA!  The smash fries were good.  The staff is always friendly.",1
"Yes, please! This place is AMAZING! I brought my family here after coming many times, and everyone LOVES IT! The wasabi mashed potatoes are KILLER! I HIGHLY recommend. I really don't know if there is anything to avoid at this place. Just love it every time! We have tried many dishes, and they are always flavorful and fabulous.",1
"FILLY-B's!!!!!  only 8 reviews?? NINE now!!!

wow do i miss THIS place:

- 24hrs
- drive-thru or walk up only
- ridiculously cheap
- ridiculously tasty

of course the arizona burritos are good, everything is good. i used to LOVE one of the combos... you get a beef burrito, taco, rice and beans... for UNDER $6.  wow.  color me silly and call me sally. they have bomb horchata too.

really good and fresh flautas/rolled tacos and breakfast burritos. damn, everything here is good, whether drunk or sober.",1
"Introduced to D'lish today by a friend. I'd already had breakfast (although the menu looks great, lots of delicious sounding, healthy options) but he suggested a Chai coffee. I don't usually like Chai Tea, but I thought I'd give the Chai coffee a chance based on his recommendation.

When I ordered, the server suggested a ""Sexy Dirty Chai"", which as lurid as it sounds means adding vanilla. The Sexy Dirty Chai Coffee over ice is hands down now my favorite coffee drink. The place is tiny, has a really cool, funky interior and also has a drive thru- a true local gem. The service is friendly and energetic and I plan to start my day here again soon :)",1
"Eh- it was just ok. I was told about the must-have Cajun fries, and they were just ok. Not spicy at all and appeared to be just like Cajun season salt sprinkled on regular fries. The fries were Kinda soggy and very greasy. Burger was ok. Tasted fresh, but I didn't know a ""regular"" burger was 2 patties. Yuck. 

Sadly- my favorite thing about this place was the fact they had Mello Yello. Sweet. 

It's good enough to eat- but it's no where near the quality of Chuckbox which is right up the street. Shoot- fatburger a stones throw away is better. 

Its good enough to eat again if your friends wanna go, but its not a place that i'll be craving or want to search for parking to eat at.

Oh well.",2
I didn't know what to expect from this store. It was over 105° so I wanted something cold! You get samples to help you or confuse you in to many choices! I went with the basic: cookies& cream mixed with vanilla carmel. Do yourself a favor & get the large so you can mix plus go on Thursday for double stamp day!,1
"Good place to meet a group, watch a game or grab a quick bite. We found this place on St. Patrick's Day after a long, frustrating day of apartment searching. No wait, quick/good/friendly service, good food and lots of good beer. I like the segmented areas and because it is so big, even when there is a huge crowd, you never feel like you have lost your personal space. Have walked over many times since and will definitely continue to.",1
"Great customer service, perfect dining area! This lightly dimmed pizzeria is nothing like the other high top table pizza places, the staff and waitress' are really friendly with along great customer service! (and I am picky with people who serve at restaurants!) this place is great for family or even with friends to get a great bite to eat. I ordered the side ""Chef Eric's Caesar salad and thin crust cheese with pepperoni"" I highly recommend For GREAT pizza! However the guy who was going to bring my pizza dropped it...but made it up by giving me Nicole's Notable Chocolate Chip cookies :)",1
"I wasn't that impressed.  The machines look old and rusted, there didn't seem to be any air-conditioning and it had to be in the 90's inside since it was about 110 outside.  They did have overhead fans.  The price was cheap--45 cents per load to wash in a top loader but we only found one top-loader available that actually worked.  Half of them were Out Of Order.  Instead we dumped everything into two front loaders that claimed to do double loads and were out of there in pretty short order.  We took the clothes back to my daughter's apartment building to dry in the laundry room there so she didn't have to stay with them.",2
"5 words....

HAPPY HOUR ON A SATURDAY!!!

Yes, every day actually! from 3-7pm and a late night happy hour too starting at 10pm!! How can that be true??? Well I guess in Arizona they know how to party! $11 pitchers and $3 pints, yes it could be a little cheaper, but hey it is a happy hour every day of the week! And their beer is really good! AND they will give you FREE samples of all of their beer too!!! This is like brewery heaven!!!

To top it off, a group of people came here in Crank or Drank shirts on their first ever biking and drinking tours and this was on their tour for good reason! Their Hefe is awesome, complete with lemon wedges of course, and their Sunbru was so so refreshing on that hot day in AZ! Adriana and I definitely had our fair share of pitchers, along with an order of their beer battered fries and their specialty ice cream cake! Well, that was actually roopas, and just an FYI, oreo crumb crust and Hefe don't really mix......so save the cake for when you are done drinking ha ha

But the waiters here (the ones that don't look like they are 15!!!!!) are helpful and friendly and nice, and you will definitely get carded here, even though literally I actually felt old here since all the girls look so young! Some of them must have had workers permits I swear!

That aside, as long as they can bring me good beer on happy hour prices, I am sold.",1
"Market Bistro never leaves me disappointed. The people are great.
The food is ALWAYS good & it doesn't matter what you get, they will cater to your needs & wants.

Definitely a must if your coming to Phoenix or if you live here, you need to try it.",1
"This place has some great food. I haven't yet found anything on the menu that I don't like instantly. The pizza, the sandwiches, the appetizers, the desserts... all good. Despite this, my favorite item on the menu is definitely the Berry Burst Cider. I haven't yet found any other decent cider in the valley.

Atmosphere: good
Service: good

My only beef: I did once have the jambalaya and that simply left me wanting authentic Cajun.",1
"Pretty good, not remarkable in any particular way.  Last minute decision to pop up to the bar for dinner last night.   Love that they have Dos Equis Amber on draft (most places only have lager).  Chips & guac were a little diappointing....  tasted like the bottom of a bag of store-bought chips... but the guac itself not too shabby.   Salsas were unique and I did enjoy their flavor.  Had the carne asada plate which comes with rice, beans, and a really delicious authentic thin tortilla.  The beef had good seasoning and flavor, but a little dry and chewy.  Fish tacos were fine, but again nothing remarkable.  Dark atmosphere, nice bartenders.  Good pinots by the glass.",0
"Everytime I think of Chodang my mouth waters. I love the spicy tofu soup they serve here along with their korean style dumplings. Their portions are just right. If you don't like spicy foods you can tell them to not make it spicy. I also love the condiments they serve before the meal. Love it!

I like their decor. The tables and walls really go together and you definitely feel like you're at an asian restaurant. Everything is neat and clean (even the bathrooms).",1
"I've been to a ton of Pho places here in the valley, and this is the best one I've been to, by far.  The prices are reasonable and the Pho was fantastic.  The rolls were pretty good, but not the best I've had around here (that honor belongs to Saigon Pho, not too far from this place.  BBQ beef rolls there are fantastic, but I digress).  I haven't tried anything else at Pho Van, but it all looked pretty good too.  

The place is super clean and the service was ridiculously fast (I don't know if it was just my luck or if that's a regular thing).

I want to come back, but it's not close to my house.  However, it's worth the drive if you ever get that Pho craving.",1
Best happy hour in north Scottsdale! Get there early to beat the crowd. Amazing cuisine and atmosphere.,1
"I was truly impressed by the quality of service and the knowledge of the employees. I have had my ears pierced at Claire's when I was 4 (way to go, Dad!) and an industrial piercing performed at Club Tattoo. I went in to adjust my bar bell for my industrial piercing and they explained a lot of things I had no clue about, like the difference in threading. The place is clean and every one is friendly. I will ONLY ever go to HTC when I need to handle my current piercings or want to get another. Thank you!",1
"I had high hopes for this restaurant, but to be honest, it let me down.  The wild mushroom and goat cheese salad was phenomenal.  From there it was downhill.  Great ambiance, though I think they are trying too hard to be a steakhouse.  

Most importantly though...  Given it is a seafood restaurant, they sure didn't know how to cook my fish.  It was fried and oily (and was not marketed that way on the menu!)  I wanted something light and left feeling like I ate a ton of bricks.  My friend's scallops - she said they were ""okay"" and not better than that.

Oh, and the prices are set as if it were a steakhouse too. (Note: if it were, which it's not.)

Mediocre at best.",2
"Hey Guys, 
This place is awesome....but I could be jaded because of all the wonderful wines I sampled! From the gris, cabs, sparkling shiraz, riesling to the chardonnay, this shop had what we were looking for and what we weren't looking for! The atmosphere was amazing and quiet for a Thursday night get together. Our hostess was sweet and doted to our every need. The food was amazing. I completely recommend the crocodile pot stickers. 
For exotic wines and exotic meats appetizers, look up Down Under Wines!",1
"-Biggest Joann's store

-Great fabric selection

-Clean store, good layout (different from other Joann stores)

-Convenient location (parking is not too bad).

-Employees are friendly.

-Restrooms are blah and smell.",1
"1 star for service and attitude.The food was delicious , but the staff was very hateful. I am writing this review. I don't remember the waitresses name but I do remember that she was short , hispanic , and she was pregnant at the time. She was incredibly hateful.So hateful and rude to me and my parents. I do know why she did this is because I am transgendered. I was wearing leggings and I was carrying a black polo purse. 

So I thought that this happened because of how I was dressed and how I looked , but that really wasn't the case.I went back 2 weeks later and I dressed differently. More ""manly"" (ha). Different waitresses , same great food , same hateful attitudes. I will stress to everyone reading this to save your time and money and go to a different pizza hut or a different pizza joint to get better service.",2
"This is seriously one of my favorite restaurants of all time. I've been many times and it's always fabulous. I LOVE their Mahi Mahi Tacos - they are so good! I also highly recommend the Pork Osco Bucco, Smoked Red Chile Pork Roast, and the Cowboy Beef Stew. The nightly specials are often very creative and delicious. This place is also good for Sunday brunch. Good bartender too - drinks are never too weak.",1
I am obsessed with this place!  I cannot say enough amazing things...I love their exhibits...I love Arcadia Farms inside...I love the architecture and design of the building...I love the staff (they are so helpful)...the gift shop is fabulous (I got the cutest watch bangle)...I love the giant red t-rex out front...I love the kids area (or at least my son does)...I love the diversity of the art!  I would recommend getting a membership because it allows you to be able go all year long with your loved ones and family!  You can have weddings here and they are beautiful!  They have events here all the time if you sign up for emails or become a member...at least just go once and you will fall in love!,1
"Duane is amazing!  Reliable, Responsive, Reasonably Priced, i simply can't reccomend him enough!  I've used him four separate times now and have been more than happy with each visit.  I won't call anyone else!",1
"even after 1.5 hours wait i loved the atmosphere and did not mind the wait at all. the service was good. not too friendly but everything we needed was on table. 
Disappointment was domestic Kobe burger. it was served overdone (just little pink in center after i ordered it medium - rare) it is served with Asian slaw ( peanut dressing) which is served on top of the burger. It was way too strong and it took away from the burger itself. it was hard to taste the meat with so much peanut sauce in the slaw. If i was to order this dish again, i would ask for slaw on the side. the fries were fantastic and fried cheese was very good. 
i will definitely be back for more for my friends loved their burgers. 
the 3 stars is for the fact that burger was way overdone and i could not taste the major component to that dish - Meat!",0
"PHENOMENAL place for Chinese cuisine. The portions are HUGE! My fiance and I always only order one thing and share it, and still always have leftovers. The menu prices are very reasonable. Including tip, we usually don't spend more than $15 for the both of us for dinner. They are very personable and attentive to your needs. I love that it is a very dainty, and has a very laid back atmosphere. The lemon chicken is our favorite!! :) They are also very kid friendly. We have an 18 month old son who always leaves a nice pile of rice on the floor every time we leave lol, but they love him! Highly recommend!",1
"I usually do not write reviews, but was so horrified by my experience I had to. Went for a late night bite and drink with a friend, they were fairly busy so we had a seat at the bar. As I frequent The Moon often, I was happy to see the bar was busy as well. The bartender quickly came over and was noticably intoxicated, as she could not even tell me the flavors of vodka they had. We ordered our drinks, and watched as she broke glass into the ice, knocked over glassware and broke a beer bottle. As we looked around most of the guests had the same look of horror on their face. We decided to order some food, as she spilled my drink on us (refilled it with something completely different) and she could barely even talk at this point. We saw management watch her behavior and do nothing, as she preceded to grab dirty glassware and refill it with beer. I was so appauled by this we left befpre finishing our drinks or food. I'm not sure what she was on but if its visible to paying customers it should be visible to management. Being beyond embarassed for the establishment, I would doubt I will come back, sad as we would frequent the Moon 2-3 times a week. Horrible.",2
"Dr. Ford is great.  She came highly recommended and I can see why.  Very focused and caring assessment of my Dog.  Bring your animals here, they will be taken care of properly.",1
"I feel like an East Coast gangster when I roll up to LGO for breakfast. I'll take the Jersey Girl... pump fist and hair toss!! Hands down, it's the BEST omelette I've EVER had. And the fresh-squeezed OJ hits the spot. 

After a hike at Camelback, it's relaxing to come and sit on the patio... if you can find a spot. Weekends this place is a zoo!! During the week is pretty crazy but has its peaks. 

The French Toast is pretty tasty and they do pastries just right. Muffins are baked fresh, toast is always spot on perfect. I want their toaster!

I've had the pizza, which is pretty decent but not the best I've eaten. The salads are delish.",1
"Walking in was like seeing a rainbow for the first time. UH-mazing! Every type of candy ever created and more candies that you've never even heard of. Best part about it was that it was super affordable. It was like a mini-costco of just candy. 

I ended up going twice on Saturday. Love it!",1
You know......first when my girl dragged me here....i thought it will suck. Once I stepped in....well....BAM! Interesting colors fill my senses. I do appreciate the set up of this place and the quirky items I found. So yea it is a chick store but still managed to entertain me.,1
"My first experience with PCG was at a small, yet fantastic Yelp event.  I've been back twice and have been just as impressed.

The first time was for brunch, and I recommend the griddled corn cakes.  No, I just don't recommend them, I insist you have them.  Even if you are allergic to corn, take the plunge and try these...unless you might die, then stay away as that might be bad PR for PCG.  Topped with smoked ham (that's what I had), chicken, or bacon and served with maple syrup, it was beyond good.  I could eat this dish every day of my life.  The black beans were okay, but I do think the breakfast potatoes are nothing special and could be improved upon.  I was a big fan of a $4 mimosa, however!  Yep, you read that right...4 bucks!

Second visit for dinner, and I ordered the cedar planked salmon.  A generous piece of fish perfectly cooked and served with a delicious lemon aioli.  The accompanying roasted beets were not my thing, and the mashed potatoes were okay (maybe I'm picky about potatoes?)  I also tried a bit of my dining companion's beef tenderloin and it was butter-knife tender (that's what I cut it with).  Served with a stuffed potato and mushrooms, I believe, it will most likely be my next entree.  For dessert, we shared the Jack Daniel's croissant bread pudding.  We actually shared half, and I most generously took the other half to my husband who I left at home.  Although, I generally don't care for bread pudding, this is NOT your typical bread pudding and probably the best bread pudding you can imagine (other than that one recipe that uses a dozen Krispy Kreme doughnuts).

Although PCG is a little bit of a drive for me (outside my usual 5-mile maximum radius), I will happily make that drive and return again.",1
"What happened to my sunday love the Orange Table? First off I have been going to this restaurant for sunday brunch forever (they have delicious mimosa's). However recently a friend of mine and I decided to grab some quick and yummy dinner here. The portions of the appetizers they are now serving to their patrons is just sad. The brie app I so love at this place was enough for two bites per person,which i assume they thought was ok because they cut up like two apples for us. If i were interested in cut up apple for an app i would have stayed home and eaten one, not gone to a restaurant and payed $10.00. The rest of the meal was just mediocre  to say the least, for a restaurant that only serves sandwiches you would think they would be absolutely incredible. The service that night was pathetic the staff there seemed less than eager to be working for Orange table. Will not be in a hurry to get back, especially when next door AZ88 has delicious food and the staff are happy and upbeat!!",2
"EXCELLENT!  What a fun time we had.  Hubby and I went out for my bday celebration and were so glad that we did.  What a fun and comfortable experience.  We walked in and were greeted right away.  We had made reservations but there was absolutely no reason to.  It was a Monday night and really @ 7:30 there wasn't a whole lot going on.  

Alec was our server.  We opted to sit in the bar area.  Same menu available.  We started off with the Haas Guac and the Green Chile Stew.  We initially made the mistake thinking that the stew was going to be like the kind @ Roaring Fork.  It's not.  They would do themselves a favor if they called it hash.  I suppose hash is not as appealing as stew.  Nonetheless it was good.  The little fry breads that they give were not my favorite but it was good with the chips that came with the guac.  I had the pork tenderloin and hubs had the mac and cheese with chicken.  Both good.  Really good.  

It would have been a five star review but there was something weird tasting in my diet coke.  Like soap or something.  Hubby thought maybe it was because they probably didn't sell a whole lot of soda product. I dunno.  Could have been the straw, the glass, syrup ratio to C02. 

And by far which is probably the best part of the restaurant.  THE BEST CHAIRS in the world.  So comfy.  So plush.  You could sit there for hours and never leave.  IF you had them in your home you would never leave.  EVER!!!!",1
"I'd leave my Scottsdale bubble for a few reasons (and yes there are additional exceptions)

1. Nobuo at Teeter House.
2. Fez.
3. My friends in various parts of the valley

and 

4. Mekong Supermarket.

I consider myself to be a huge fan of Asian cuisine. Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, Indian. You name it, I'll eat it. I have my healthy moments, but I am a seasoned eater and I am not afraid of exploring the world through my palate.

Mekong is the perfect place for me to massage my senses. The aroma and sensations from the exotic product. The stunning visual of a catfish being bopped on the head, and then cut up and packaged. The cheesy elevator music on the loudspeaker. The delicious taste of a spring roll from the hot food bar. 

This place has it all.

I usually come here for my Asian condiments and live seafood. Want a live crab? Boom. Done. Want spicy mustard or sriracha in a large bottle for cheap? It's yours.

To me, there is nothing like taking the 10 mile drive in traffic to Mekong because I know I am going to get everything I want. 

Make the trek. You won't regret it.",1
"Popped in for a quick meal before a show. Fun decor, brand new and sparkling clean, with a nice sized menu. We chose this restaurant because it advertised gluten free pasta. Unfortunately, no one on staff seemed to know what ""gluten free"" meant. When we asked which sauces might be GF to go with the GF pasta, we were met with blank stares. It took several questions to determine that the marinara sauce ""might"" be GF -not very confidence inspiring. When we did get our meals, everything tasted fine, not fabulous, about on par with a Pei Wei type experience. I had a small side house salad, which was not on the menu, but was offered by the girl at the register.  The greens were nice, but not chilled, which was kind of yucky.  The balsamic vineagrette was not able to be GF certified, so I had it on the side.  It was just OK.  My GF pasta was cooked properly, and the portion was large but not too large.  I had the primavera with marinara sauce, and while the veggies seemed fresh, they were a tad overcooked.  My husband had a pizza, seemed to be pretty good.  My daughter had a kids meal of chicken tenders and fries--the tenders were a chicken breast cut into slices, which worked, and the fries were a tad bit reminiscent of Burger King's, with some parmesan thrown on top.  The kid's meal also came with mini donuts, which we had to ask for 3 times, but there were fresh out of the fryer and covered in cinammon sugar--yummy.  We ordered ice cream with a GF chocolate chip cookie--and what arrived was definitely not a ""cookie""--more like a gluey, gooey chocolate chip amoeba at the bottom of a dish with 2 scoops of ice cream on top.  Eh.

I tried to order an espresso machiato at the coffee bar in back of the restauant--the coffee girl didn't know the correct way to make the drink, so I opted for a soy cappucino--this was tasty and well done.


This is clearly a new business still working out the kinks. I think it's a good option if you're in downtown PHX and need a quick, decent meal.",0
"Rally burger is a pretty great alternative to McD's or BK, and its somewhat unfortunate that there aren't more locations in the Phoenix area. Their seasoned fries are awesome and even better with chili. What I was really impressed with, though, is their value burger selection and flavor. A simple rally burger is a buck and change and seems like some of the non-value burgers at other fast food. Good condiment to meat ratio, and flavorful. And no skimping here...you get all the condiments even on a value burger: lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion...all that. The other thing I really liked was they have a value buffalo chicken burger which was actually really tasty. All in all, yes its fast food, but its a different flare with unique options and arguably better quality in some areas.",1
"Buca Di Beppo is literally, italian restaurant hell. You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage? Buca Di Beppo throws junk, and knick knacks and statues and anything else 'italian' they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods. It's a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta.


It's embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here. Thin, flavorless alfredo sauce. Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix. I went with a large group and across the table, bland food.

When they seat your party, they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello. Deep down you know they hate this. Why are we in the kitchen? Sure it's nice, but I'd rather have them concentrating on making the food, and making it good. Of course, the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good. It's just dead. Dead food. No life, no flavor, not emotion. I get more flavor from the $.99 Michelina's frozen lunch package.

Far from claiming anything authentic Italian, Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste. Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility. No salt, no sugar, no butter, no fat, it's all gone along with anything resembling taste. Sure, Buca has huge portions, and the setup is nice for large parties and families - but they might as well just buy the family-size pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home, even that would be better, and they wouldn't have to the mandatory gratuity. Say what you will about other italian chains like Macaroni Grill, or Olive Garden - at least their food taste like something.",2
"Not bad, but definitely not my first choice. If I were to eat pizza in the restaurant, then this is a good choice. But there are better choices for take-home pizza.",0
I've always been treated well @ D'ambrosio's despite my not exactly being 'N Scottsdale plastic'. :),1
"I don't get the hype, but then again I am not a regular. 

The beer selection is top notch, the sandwiches are worth the prices, the cheesecake really shouldn't be drowned in chocolate syrup but who cares, it really is a nice people watch place. I appreciate the well composed menu and not much more can be said. It has reliable service and sandwiches, hipsters and good beer. The lack of surprises make it a good place to take out of towners to see downtown and introduce people to First Fridays if you wanna brave potential waits, noise levels, and lack of parking on busy nights.",0
"I feel bad giving them a mediocre rating but I'm reviewing what's in their NAME. I drove about 9 miles across Gilbert (that is quite a chore) because I wanted to serve good roast beef sandwiches for dinner and I needed good bread. 

I had Boar's Head roast beef, tomatoes, horseradish sauce, avocado, roasted red peppers etc I just needed great bread. Where else in Gilbert should I go? I did a Yelp search and it agreed - to this place. 

I arrived around 4:15 and the pickings were slim. I got the last round of sourdough and a small nine grain. I asked her to slice thick, she walked to the slicer and said it has one setting. Okay I'll slice myself. 

Because I love Cupcakes I also took a chocolate cupcake and my boys got a chewy brownie each. The total was about $16. 

We got home the bread was hard (both) soft on the deep inside so I had to grill the sandwiches with butter not my plan but it's butter, butter fixes everything. 

The cupcake frosting was good I ate the top threw away the 'cup' not worth the calories. I only allowed the boys to eat half the brownie each and save the other half for tomorrow as they were huge. The said they were really good. 

Basically, I'll buy my bread at the grocery store or at Paradise bakery as the wasted gas and time in the car was not worth it.",0
"I'd have to say that among the restuarants in the Tom Jetland suite (Fez, Ticoz, Switch), Ticoz is my favorite because of its dimly-lit lounge-like quality, which provides it a cozier feel than the other two.  Add to that, the hypnotic Mojito creations and Ticoz is one of those places I could spend an entire weekend late afternoon at, as long as someone else drives, of course.

The tamales are fantastic and are more similar to corn pudding than to traditional hand rolled tamales.  If you get them with veggies, you'll find that the veggies are a little oddly cut for the dish, so I recommend some other topping.  The beef is fantastic (especially in the tacos).

All in all, this is one of my current favorites.",1
"This place is very off-the-beaten-track, I'm sure most people overlook it....I only came across it whilst searching online for somewhere 'different' to eat...and when I came across the review on the Phoenix New Times website(http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2005-02-10/dining/sultans-of-shish/), I knew this was it...

I only docked a star for the (extremely) sparse decor and atmosphere...this place could have been any other type of business with just a change of sign and omission of tables...

anyway, the food was great! my fiance ordered skewers of beef and lamb(I'm not too keen on lamb, but the beef was tender and succulent...very well spiced!)...I had a cucumber salad(diced, along with onions and parsley, and soaked in vinegar-lemon juice), which enchanted me so much that I created my own version at home and make it every time I feel like doing a bit of dicing(msg me for the recipe--it's a bit death-breathy and labor-intensive but delicious!)...

and, during dessert, I could see why Samarkand was voted 'Best Tea in Phoenix'...the black tea was easily the best I've ever had(besides a special brand of blue ginger tea I make a point to keep my cabinet stocked with)...it was strong and rich...absolutely incredible!

definitely make it a point to search this place out--it's worth the effort!",1
"Their food was GREAT! I had the pancit, lumpia, and that purple rice! The price was not bad for the amount of food that they gave you!

Even though they had a very long line they were still very fast with service!",1
"my son loves the splash pad! His dad or uncles stay with him at the playground while I can run in the store or two that I need to! There are quite a few empty retail spots, hopefully they can get some new stores in there as well,",1
"Agree with most posters about the setup - left much to be desired.

I was smart and arrived BEFORE 4:00 P.M. so I could jump in early for some short and FAST lines.  My 15-yr-old son was with me, and he's a fairly picky eater, which was one reason I brought him - so he could see that there are other foods he might like if he TRIED them.

I got a lot of food between 4:00 and 4:30, when the lines were short.  I probably got to try 10 trucks before we left at 5:07.  We went back to some trucks more than twice or three times when we found something we liked.

My advice for future events:

1.  Help the trucks deliver the samples FASTER.  Not sure how - maybe get them an extra staff member?  But the samples on some trucks were coming SLOWLY, so that needs to improve.

2.  Better location, maybe not on dirt, and maybe a little larger.  Once the lines got up to 20-30 people, the going was CRAMPED and it was taking a long time to get your samples.

3.  Maybe a lower price for tickets?  Seemed kinda steep for the amount of food each person received.

All in all, I enjoyed the FOOD, but the rest of the logistics, not so much.",0
Amazing!  The Chicken sausage pasta definitely works!,1
"FEZ... The two times that I went it was in the afternoon on the weekend. Both times, I was able to enjoy a great lunch with my sister and cousin and then again with my sister. The two dishes I liked were the FEZ burger and the Casa Blanca Chicken.  The berry shortcake was good, however the water from the strawberries sort of killed the whipped cream and the shortcake (biscuit) was very good.

Overall the environment during those times were peaceful and quiet. The staff offered advice on the menus. The price a little high for my wallet but I would definitely come back to splurge with great company in tow.",0
"well everyone there is pretty nice i got gel tips from them and i do beat them up pretty bad at work and they are holding up as they should. they were reasonably priced. There is one Asian lady i like a lot i forgot her name though my fault. I also got a pedicure from them as well they did good.

PROS:
* inexpensive 
* good color selection
* nice people
*television available

CONS:
*Some of my tips are longer than others
*When i got a pedicure the water was so hot it burned me feet and they came out of the water looking like cherry tomatoes
*whenever i seem to give them the tip off my visa they seem almost disappointed since its not cash (i dont carry cash and im not starting anytime soon)
*the language barrier but its no one's fault
*the massaging pedi chairs are made for people taller than me *sigh*

Since the cons outweigh the pros it gets 3 stars but you are still getting really good service considering how much you pay for it and i will continue to give them my business because the lady who gave me the pedicure was really nice and she did a really good job getting rid of my callouses and didnt torture me too bad (im extremely ticklish).",0
"I have a cooking problem- I can't do it. However, I loved coming to Entrees to Go to make our meals. My husband bought a Groupon for this place and we decided to try it out. It was a wonderful experience, and that means a lot coming from me since I am not a fan of cooking. 

I love the concept of Entrees to Go. You prepare your meal at this place and bring them home in a baggie.  Meals ready to cook and no mess in my kitchen = awesomeness! Everything you need to know to prepare your food is explained and if you have any questions they are answered immediately. 

The only downfall...The price w/o a Groupon is a little pricey. Three full size entrees (each entree serving 4-6) is regularly $80. It's great if you work full-time and don't have time to cook on your own but it's a little high for my pocketbook. However, if money wasn't a factor I would cook every meal at Entrees to Go. 

Loved it!",1
"The cool name of the place is the only good thing here. The burgers are below-average and unenjoyably (is that a word?) messy. Fries, too greasy. Seating, not comfortable. Skip it!",2
"Lets just say i was not to please with my experience at Nails R Us. After two days my nails were lifting on about 4 nails by the end of the weekend i had 6 nails lifting, so i went back and showed them and she was like its normal. No it normal to lift but not after 2 days! They did fix them for me free of charge but were very rude to me!!! Will not be going back there or will not refer any of my friends there!",2
"If I could give zero stars, I would.  I have never spent more time looking for a bar than I have looking for this. And not like a cool underground dance club in L.A.  When we finally found this sh*thole sandwiched between two vacant businesses, it was barely visible.  The sign for it looked like it was written with a sharpie on a piece of cardboard and someone duct tapped a flashlight to it.  Before we even entered the bar, as my friend and I were walking up two redneck bikers whispered, ""Fags"" as we walked by them.  I don't think these were the kind of guys you argued with so I let it go.  When we entered the bar I noticed several ""No firearms"" signs plastered on the walls.  I'm assuming they've had a problem with this before.  Remember that scene in the Blues Brothers where they go to the country bar and get the look of death from the patrons?  That's how I felt.  The decor of this bar was interesting.  It looked as if they got the tables and chairs from an old 70s Vegas casino.  The place is about the size of a small apartment's living room so getting a seat is pretty much impossible.  We went to the bar to do some karaoke, but apparently they also sell crappy jewelry for some reason?  Weird.  I've also never heard so much cussing from karaoke singers.  One of the drunken hicks actually got into a shouting match with one of the morbidly obese toothless tattooed bicker chicks where they argued who was the bitch and who was the pussy.  Halfway through my beer, my friends showed up and they refused to go inside so I ran away and never looked back.  TIP: If you go here wear a black leather jacket, bandana and Harley Davidson gear.",2
Unfortunately Out of Business.,1
"They don't have the lunch specials on the menu or tell you about them if you don't ask, so make sure to ask. The sandwiches don't come with fries and their fries are over priced for not being very good. The pulled pork sandwich is good and so is the sauce. Also, expect a long wait especially if people are ahead of you.",0
"I go to Pro's Ranch Market often for lunch- sometimes several times a week. I've had the street tacos, chile relleno, burritos, and some other tasty treats. I'm a huge fan of the agua fresca stand- my favorites are the strawberry, pineapple, and horchata. And the bakery... oh, the bakery. They have everything sweet you could want including individual servings of flan and tres leches cake. 

The store itself has the cheapest produce in town, a giant meat counter, and a great assortment of cheeses. Ranch Market also has super delicious tortilla chips and salsas. This is one of my favorite places to go if I'm on my way to a BBQ or party- there are so many options!",1
"I recently tried OHSO. Nice layout and design... modern and casual. Their menu features cheese and charcuterie plates, flatbreads, burgers, and other comfort-style dishes. I had the grilled cheese with a cup of tomato soup. The tomato soup reminded me of pepperoni pizza, which was strange at first but actually pretty good. It was the perfect order for a chilly, rainy day. The 48th Street Fizz (orange vodka, pineapple, lemon, st. germaine, and beer) was sweet, but tasty (love cocktails with carbonation). They have an extensive list of local and regional beers. Overall, it's a nice little neighborhood spot.",1
"Carmel Bianca!!! Oh my Effin Gosh... that's the stuff! It's yum. I'm a fan of white chocolate flavored coffee so maybe I'm bias and why I simply enjoyed my 16oz of Carmel Bianca goodness. It's simply espresso, steamed milk, white chocolate and carmel drizzled on top. And that's the signature drink of Dolce Espresso.

Thanks to Yelp I decided last night after a driving lesson with L that I was too tired to drive home without something to pick me up... and that was reason enough to make the short trek to Dolce because I've always wanted to try it. Wasn't exactly sure where it was, and happy to find that it's just across from Padre's next to a Psychic place. Dolce has a cool vibe with music videos playing. And they're good songs too... like I had never seen Pitbull's ""The Anthem"" video... liked it! Enjoyed my Carmel Bianca with a slice of their Chicago Style Cheesecake. I liked the cheesecake because it was different in taste compared to other cheesecakes, it was like a marzipan with cheese frosting on top... so it was interesting. Not really a fan of the German Choc that my friends K and D got. I thought it was dry... yuck! 

It's a small place that's bright, with four flat screens spread about. The owner, Cesar (I think) was a sweetheart! I just hope Dolce survives as a 24 hour cafe on weekends because this place has potential. It's way better than counterculture cafe back in the day. This is like the best place to go after the bars if you need a pick me up before heading home to the eastside from central Phoenix. Prices are moderate. SO pls check this place out and spread the word... love it and I'll be back!",1
"5 ENTHUSIASTIC STARS

This is a large, well maintained botanical garden, teeming with birdlife and abundant in blooming cacti, succulents & other flowers.

Even though it can be HOT, it is very easy to spend half a day here, as we did, wandering the trails. If you need a break, there is a patio cafe where you can get a cool one.

This place is a true delight and a great asset for Phoenix.",1
"As I passed the velvet rope flanked by shiny, exotic cars I knew I was in for an experience.  Some might call it a fine-dining experience, but clearly this was something more.  A tribute to opulence and Regan-era excess, Dominick's is your seven-figure foodie fantasy come alive; from the moment you enter the swanky foyer to the gleaming 10 inch tower of tiramisu that finishes your meal.  It's glittery, bedazzled, and oozing pretension - and I loved it.

The Service
My visit to Dominick's was the night after it's official opening.  The service tried very hard to be as impeccable as the surroundings and, while not perfect, the charming staff and the sincere effort put forth made little things like missing napkins and bread plates instantly forgivable.  Our server, Drew, let us know that the wait staff only had 2 - 3 tables each and it was very evident in the personal service we received.  A few more weeks of experience for the staff should easily iron out the little wrinkles.

The Food
We started with the jumbo shrimp appetizer, which unfortunately came with 3 shrimp - hardly conducive to sharing - so we ordered two. And ""Jumbo"" they certainly were, accompanied by a kicky cocktail sauce which my dinner companion felt was spicy enough.  Ever the daredevil, I added additional horseradish to mine because who doesn't like to burn the inside of their nostrils at dinner.
For the main course we both had the 9-oz filet, lobster gnocchi and steamed asparagus.  My filet was a perfect rare-plus with a dark pink center, expertly seared and juicy.
Surprisingly the lobster gnocchi really stole the show for me.  I'm not big on starches or cream sauces so when it was suggested I wasn't particularly excited; I should have been.  The dough was light and fluffy, the cream sauce not too rich and the lobster added the perfect amount of salt & texture.
After dinner I indulged in a grand marnier while my companion ordered the tiramisu.  He was presented with a 10 inch tall hunk of cake that could easily have been intended for 4 people.  The tiramisu was spongy and light, with a lovely cool custard and only a subtle flavor of rum.  A nice finish to an excellent meal.  

Atmosphere
We were lucky enough to score a poolside table which started off as very romantic but over the course of the evening became quite the place for people watching.  The scene at the small bar area on the 2nd floor was bustling and both the waiters and I wondered aloud how long it would be before a guest fell in the pool.  I bet they didn't make it through the weekend without someone making a splash.",1
"Oh, where to begin..

I stopped by Pappadeaux last week to grab a bite when on a Wed, they told me it was a 45min wait for two.. wow.  The place was packed.   The hostess recommended we make a reservation for the weekend, so we made one for Friday at 7PM.

The smells coming from the place when you first pull in automatically keep you wondering what delicious things are waiting inside.  

I'm so glad we did. 

We showed up and they gave us a card with a number and once our number showed up on the screen, it was seating time.  I think we waited maybe ten minutes.

After gazing over the menu for a quick minute, we decided to try the fried alligator with creole sauce.  Being one to enjoy new things, I was pretty excited.  The waiter took our drink orders and and put in the appetizer.  The place at this point was insanely packed, but it was nice to see a place like this.  Made ya feel that something good was to come.  Heck, a place cant' suck if it's this packed, right?   So we order our food, I decided on the stuffed shrimp and the rest of my friends all ordered different things.  It would be a share-a-meal night.. 

About 10min into drinks and conversation, they bring out the fried alligator..  Ok, if you've never eaten anything weird before.  Please please.. you've got to try this.  It sorta reminded me of a cross between soft pork or chicken.  The taste literally melted in my mouth.  To top it off, the creole sauce that went with it, only complimented it.  I could easily have eaten the entire plate alone.  Sadly, I had to share..

After quickly destroying the fried alligator, we got our entrees.  I took one bite and had to pause a moment.. the taste of the stuff shrimp with the crab, Alfredo, spices inside just floored me.  There were only six pieces, but after sharing a piece or two and eating the amazing green beans, this was plenty of food. 

I can't wait for my next trip here.. fantastic food.",1
"For cheap pizza, it's as good as it gets. More selection than the other cheap pizza places, and the quality is way better.  The wings are delicious also, especially the Cajun flavor!!! If your looking for something like one of the big chains, then go there, but this is good for the money. If you want gourmet pizza, then go pay for it, don't look for it at the bargain places.  I paid $29 for an XL pizza with two toppings and 20 wings, and everyone was happy!  Just know that it's really fast pizza, but it's better than the other big guys!",0
"There food is pretty good here but they have a lot of different brews, I tried a pumpkin beer witch was very good. This place used to be real quite and unnotice now it's always busy and very crowded. It is located away from mill ave by about 3 miles so if your trying to bar hop make sure you have a dd and stop by this place.",1
Love this studio! Teachers are nice and accomodating. This is possibly one of the best yoga classes I have studied. This is a place where you sweat your ass off while listening to music and meditating. Love Sumits Yoga and love the studio in Chandler. Best part is the practice is expanding so check out the website. www.sumitsyoga.com,1
"stopped here on our way home on a road trip.  if i had known, i would've stopped on the way out, too.  the bear name drew me in (and the assumption that a diner would have chocolate malts).  

the food was fantastic.  boyfriend ordered ""bob's big bear burger"" and it was probably the biggest hamburger i've seen in person.  apparently it was delicious (how he ate the whole thing, i will never know).  i ordered some sort of burger basket combo, featuring a much smaller cheeseburger (which was delicious), hearty portion of fries (which were ok), and the chocolate malt was only $2.99 (instead of $4.50-ish)  with the combo.  And it was one of the best chocolate malts I've ever had.  And the prices were reasonable.  And I actually loved the kitschy bear theme.  Can't wait for another trip that takes me through Phoenix (and I never thought I would say that).",1
"I'm sorry. You're too busy to look up my club card information? Too busy too push the button to do the search, enter my phone number and click ok?

I took the time once upon whenever to sign up for your card. And now, you can't take 5 seconds to look it up for me? Let me clue you in, the cashiers here have always looked it up. It always takes 5-10 seconds at most! Great customer service. Insert sarcasm here for the uneducated.

Other Big Lots this hasn't been a problem. Just the one.",2

"I love their strawberry drink, its not really agua fresca because it's a little on the thicker side, but still tasty.. I've tried their sonoran dog & it wasn't that great. It was too soggy. (Get your ass to Tucson to experience a good sonoran dog). (FYI: El Guero Canelo is amazing!)
I've also tried their menudo & carne asada torta. But my favorite is the California Burrito. If your in the area & want Mexican food it's a great place to go.",1
"As I promised myself, I'd go back again to try it again. Yyyeeaahhhh...sooooo....the food is still not good. I got the mongolian beef and it's like ""wha? really? is this IRL?""

"This was one of my favorite places to get take out pizza and salad from on a weekly basis.  
Unfortunately, it looks like they have closed their doors.  I have tried calling for the past week and no one answers the phone.  I finally drove past the location and there is a note on the door stating they did not fulfill their rent payments.  I am only giving this place a 3 star because of utter disappointment, otherwise the food earns 5 stars!
The Gluten Free cheese pizza was the best gluten free pizza I had ever tasted.  They used a thin rice crust with organic tomato sauce and low fat mozzarella cheese.  The place was small inside and lacked much ambiance, but made for a great delivery/ to-go restaurant.  

I will miss you Z Pizza!",0
Just happened to be in the neighborhood when we saw this BBQ place.  The pulled pork and beef did not disappoint.  The sandwiches can be called 'hardy' portions on large buns.  The sauce was excellent.  The place is very clean.  Very good service.  Was not impressed with the coleslaw - seemed flat.  Will return as the high ratings of this establishment are well deserved.,1
"I love Honey Bear's!  I've been visiting their restaurants for years.  I've been to the one on Van Buran, the one on Central and this one in Tempe.  They have the runniest sauce on earth but dang it tastes great!  I love the pulled pork sandwiches but not the long lines at lunch.  When I went after 1pm in the afternoon I stood in a line of one - me.",1
Great place to grab some quick mexifood. Service at this location has been great. Fast and efficent. Try the pick two for a healthier smaller portions!,1
"I was in town early for a sales meeting at the Crowne Plaza Resort, just up the street. I walked over to Latitude Eight for dinner. 

It was a pleasant surprise! It's a quaint little place, quiet, clean, probably a great place for a date or a quiet conversation. The owner and his wife run the place, it seems, with some competent and friendly help.

The decor is modern, subdued, and futuristic. It's comfortable.

I sampled an excellent microbrew while savoring a salad with a nice asian dressing, bean sprouts, lettuce, carrot, cucumber, and some other goodies. 

Then came the Panang Curry Chicken with white rice. Whoa! Just the right amount of complex flavor and heat. It was so good, I ate every bite, and had no room left for dessert!

This was among the top two or three best Thai meals I've eaten over the years, and I've probably had 50 or so. I wish I had been able to go back again during this trip. I suggested it to several people at our meeting, and heard several other good comments from people who wandered over to it.",1
"This place is gem behind the Central Phoenix library and next to Walgreens. They have great lunch specials that are worth a visit. My favorite dish so far is the spicy noodles. The noodles were flavorful and pretty darn spicy, just how they should be. If you're in the mood for some authentic Thai food, you gotta give this place a try.",1
"There are two places in Phoenix that have the BEST barbecue sauce.  Honey Bears is the ""Not sweet"" one, LoveJoys is the ""Sweet"" one.  Love them both.",1
"We went there for the first time recently and was pleasantly surprised. We got there about 8pm on a Friday night and the place was still packed. We only waited maybe 5 minutes to get a table which wasn't bad at all. 

My date had the BBQ Chicken Sandwich with a side salad. While we were waiting for his salad to come out the server came over and said there was a mistake as he should have already receive his salad and it would be right up, which it was so not a huge deal. A few minutes later our meals came out. While he was hoping it was shredded chicken it was a chicken breast but said it was still quite tasty. I had the 10oz rib eye with sides of green beans and applesauce. The steak was cut perfectly and it was a perfect size portion. The green beans (which the server suggested) were awesome and the applesauce was a nice sweet finish so no dessert was needed. Another bonus is everything (steak, beans, applesauce) were all served on separate plates so no runny juices mixing all over the place which was perfect!!!! 

The prices were very reasonable as well. 

Overall, we both enjoyed Texas Roadhouse and will certainly be back.",1
Fast service. Great burgers and fries. So far the Arizona burger coupled with sweet potato fries is my favorite.,1
"Open 24 hours on week-ends, ample seating area (good for studying or hanging out and chatting), very welcoming clientele, and broad selection of coffee drinks, non-coffee drinks, and desserts, fruits, and random snacks.

The coffee isn't great but not terrible either. The Wi-Fi, while free, is fickle. 

One of my two favourite coffee places in Tempe (other is Cartel off University & Ash).",1
"Imagine for a minute that you're waiting in a really long line. No, it's not the line ride. You see a menu on the wall with your ordering options, but before you are anywhere near someone that could take your order, you're yelled at.

""Hey! What do you want?""

Don't be afraid, but don't be surprised either. Keep your cool and order your dogs. Immediately start thinking about if you want fries or rings (onion rings) and be prepared for when you're called upon again. Then watch as your hot dog is mutilated in front of your eyes and what appears on your tray is what looks like a hot mess of decapitated food.

Never fear though... because it is amazing. Well worth the wait and one of the best dogs you'll ever have. My favorites here are the white hot and the bratwurst. Whenever I know I'm going, I end up salivating like Pavlov's dog for hours.

The booths are classic hot dog stand style and the pennants lined up along the top of the walls are fantastic to look at. One started a whole conversation and research one day about a basketball team we knew nothing about.",1
"I stayed at the Firesky Resort before taking my MCAT and have mixed feelings about my stay. Now granted, I had extremely high anxiety at the time so perhaps I didn't get to see the full glory of this place, but in my opinion it is somewhat overrated. For the price I paid, I expected more. 

The resort layout is more like a fantastically designed apartment complex. In fact, I am pretty sure that it was an apartment complex prior to being a resort. With that said, however, the lobby and grounds are absolutely phenomenal. They are stylish, comfortable, and luxurious without being ostentatious. 

My room was a little bit less impressive though. It had most of the amenities that I expected, but nothing extra. The artwork wasn't overly impressive and the linens were just average. Also, the TV was small. It certainly wasn't nearly as glorious as the common areas of the resort.

The deck/balcony area was very nice though and I was able to study in the fresh air without any distractions.

If you are wanting to stay at a reasonably nice hotel that is close to everything, the Firesky fits the bill. However, don't expect to be wowed by your room. It is an average room. Nothing less, nothing more.",1
"Solid. We hit up the happy hour which features 50% off booze and tacos for $1.50. I had the duck, shrimp, and cochinita pibil (pork). They were tinier than most street-style tacos I've had (and boy howdy, have I eaten a lot of those from Cali to NY) and  even a little soggy. The duck was my least favorite as it had a rubbery taste and texture. The shrimp was A-OK but for my money, the cochinita was really where it's at with his super-porkey deliciousness. We also split the queso fundido (rich with cream cheesey chunks, whaaaat???). It was way tasty but it could probably double for spackle in a pinch. The most successful item of the night was the churros with goat cheese caramel. Between my 3 buddies and myself, we made quick work of that dish. Each of us had their house margarita which was strong (just like I like it), but I'm not entirely sure I'd order that drink for non-happy hour prices. One of the big drawbacks, however, was that our server was really rushed and we had a hard time getting his attention. 

On the whole, I think I'd be back to try some other items. The chicken mole torta looked really appealing. Be forewarned though, it IS a spendy joint. Expect to pay $15 - $20 for most entrees. On a post-grad shoestring budget, it is certainly a splurge. We did love the mural outback and the groovy art inside.",0
"CASH ONLY!  But we easily feed a family of 4 hungry people for less than $20 and it's not Taco Bell.  So with that being said... the Grilled Pork #5 sandwich... oh hell ya... it's good ringing in at only $2.85.  The regular Turkey / Ham on a crossaint is about $4.25 and it's the size of a small football... great value... you could probalby get by with the small croissant sandwich instead for  only $1.95... yeah... it's crazy cheap.  Hot wings are generic prebreaded with a kick of spiciness.   The steamed bun is sweet dough..however, not my favorite... my husband and sister seem to love the egg and meat inside.  The ice cream is all homemade...also another great deal at $.99 cents for a cone... check out the icecream...looks crazy good.  Don't miss out on taking home some baked goods... the baguettes are crusty-soft and warm when you get them.  The croissants are delicious and some of the better ones here in the valley.  I did try and Avacodo boba...had to send it back...not sure what the heck it was...it was green... but didn't taste anything like Avacado... so I did head across the way to Boba tea house for my bobas.  The Viet coffee, also great kick for you mentally if you need a boost, very strong=very good.  Don't miss out on this place... it's a good go to place for a great lunch or snack.",1
"The ""Protein Pancakes"" are always a treat, but the ""California Eggs Benedict"" was just awful today.  The biggest disappointment were the hash browns though.  They tasted like shredded cardboard.  I am tired of going to a restaurant 20 to 30 times and getting such inconsistent results.

Shame on you US Egg!",2
"I have past this place a million times and always wanted to stop and I finally did. It was good. The only thing that was fabulous was the cheese crisp. It was actually crispy must places its just a soft tortilla with cheese, I can do that in my own microwave. I didn't have the refried beans but they looked watery and not so good. I enjoyed this place and will come back but besides the cheeses crisp it was average but good.",1
"Bobby Q is GREAT! We enjoyed EVERYTHING: brisket sandwich, baby back ribs, brisket with spicy sauce - yum!!! Blooming onion - just right! Baked potato crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside  withe barbeque pork and the fixings......mmmmmmmm!  Our waitress perfect - Go - now!",1
"I'm a sucker for sweet potato fries!  Any place serving this yummy delicious ingredient deserves my love.  I think I can survive off this for 30 days....any reality TV show takers...huh..huh?  Well, over food was really excellent.  Gourmet burgers are to die for aren't they!?  Sorry Carl's Jr...your $6 burger -- really?  I had the number 3 here - yeah sounds like a secret Chinese sauce, but better!  My burger was cooked just right - juicy and medium-well.  The service was good and the atmosphere tries to re-enact modern hip fine dining.  Though you probably wouldn't know the difference after a few bottles here :) - enjoy!",1
"Great at first, then the bartender ignored me and my friends for a good 20-30 minutes, put everyones bill on my tab. I opened a tab so this wouldn't happen then they made us wait another 15 for them just to ask us who had what. Then they over charged us by quit a bit. We had to flag someone f=down from napkins and plates and it took a few try's for a water. And to make matters worse my friend got a parking ticket because they took so long. There were three bartenders for what I handle myself at a bar on a daily basis. No sorry from any of them and not even a drip of regret from the manager. He pretty much told us to chill out after this whole 45 min waiting or deal, just to close a check. Kind of a joke really.",2
"Decided to roll the dice on a Saturday night and try this place everyone's been raving about. Despite showing up at prime time to a packed house we got a table relatively quickly. 

The food was delicious and came out promptly. I didn't any problems with the wait staff like others have expressed. The presentation was a little more than expected without feeling pretentious or like I had to keep my elbows off the table; not that I'm a slob.

Didn't get a chance to make it upstairs but the main dining and bar areas were well-lit but still cozy and had a simple, modern feel.

Good place for a date or toss back a few cold ones with your crew. St. Francis is definitely on my list now.",1
"Wow, is this some fantastic food! It was the first non chain restaurant we ate at during our vacation and I couldn't be more pleased. Not only was the staff friendly and attentive, the food was phenomenal. Presentation and taste were top notch. The Tai fried rice was the best fried rice I've ever had. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town.

aaand no I am absolutely NOT Cher haha just one of her very satisfied customers.",1
"I have to say I was pretty disappointed with our brunch experience here. 

Ok class, let's have a lesson. What makes a good, traditional, Eggs Benedict? 

Easy question, you say?

Answer: Nice crispy, toasted English muffin, meat of your choosing (let's go with Canadian Bacon), creamy delicious Hollandaise.

What am I missing, class?

Ah yes, a beautiful poached egg, which bursts when pierced, spilling it's silky, golden yolk. 

Ok so now that we've had our lesson, let's put it into practice. My eggs Benedict was served with three quartered tomatoes, very very very crunchy potatoes with no seasoning and two eggs Benedict. One was completely missing a yolk! Bummer. When our server came over, I told him and he brought out a new one, but the yolk was overcooked. Bummer, times two. My friend also had an overcooked egg on his plate.

For the prices they're charging, we should have had four perfectly cooked eggs and well seasoned potatoes. It's brunch, not brain surgery. 

The space is beautiful, and the server was pleasant, but I won't come back. Too many other places to try for brunch.",0
"This is a beautiful store. Its huge and spacious. The workers are friendly and helpful. You can't go wrong with cute, nerdy boys who help you fix things! :]",1
"I'm in (puppy) love with the new Wag N'Wash in Scottsdale...

I'd been to the Phoenix location years ago and remember wishing they were closer to my home, and my wish was granted... this new location is less than a mile from where I live!

Minnie and I popped in a few weeks back for a self-serve bath.  I initially called to see if a groomer was in, but they were booked out for weeks.  Doing it myself was actually not only cheaper, but it was fun... and a good bonding experience for me and Min as well.  Sara helped us out and explained our options.  We decided on the ultimate wash which included an extremely efficient shampoo and conditioner, brushes, towels, cologne, etc... It was easy and quick - bonus! Minnie was clean and fresh within 20 minutes or so!

Of course we spent a tad bit more time at the store doing some shopping and I was impressed with the dog food selection, homemade treats, eco-friendly collars and leashes, etc...

I'll definitely head back to Wag N' Wash again really soon... so psyched that they moved to my 'hood!",1
"Met for a business meeting, good happy hour menu, we had the flatbread which was great to share over our meeting with some of their house bread, which was excellent with the pesto.

The well whiskey was poured nicely and our server was nice.

Great for happy hour biz meetings on the waterfront, but only 3 tables in the bar, so you better get there early.",1
"This place is great!
If you talk to anybody they have a suggestion for a great flavor.
You can bring in food from another place to enjoy and just enjoy a great atmosphere.
With the music that someone has an issue with you can just talk to the DJ to get a suggestion they are MORE than accommodating.
They have a great happy hour prices! 
Overall great prices, great people, and a great time! If you have the right mind :)",1
"Went to try it out yesterday morning.  The service was so-so.  It wasn't crowded, and it took awhile for me to be noticed (and I'm 6'2"", 275!)The Arbuckle's coffee was great.  Ordered the #2.....2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 sausage patties and 2 strips of bacon for $5.99.  Everything was fine except the sausage which had a peculiar flavor....the bacon strips were thick and tasty, the eggs okay, and the cakes were very good with an interesting touch....instead of the normal one glob of butter on top of the two cakes, there was one on top and one between the two cakes (made for easy buttering of the bottom cake).  All in all worth another try (might have been just an off day for the sausage).  Wish it were closer to home!",0
"Ok, I hesitated writing a review of this place because I like that it's not busy, but I want the place to survive because I enjoy it so much. 

I hate gyms...I mean LOATHE them. From rude staff to unpleasant odors or creepy guys giving you longing looks while you're just trying to figure out which one of your friends with an advanced degree in engineering you can text to help you figure out how to get on a machine without having it rip your arm out of its socket because the staff is not going help you without paying for a personal trainer or because you don't look like you were already born on a nautilus machine. 

This gym is everything but. I went in because of the great introductory special and a recommendation of a friend. We're both training to swim the SF Bay for the 2011 Sharkfest Alcatraz Swim, so we needed a pool. 

As soon you walk in, the guy at the front desk treats you like you're an old buddy and cracks jokes like he is your best bar buddy. Awesome attitude. The place has never been overly crowded (even at peak hours right after work. I've never gone during the early morning or lunch hours).

No waits on the machines and they have plenty of them. No waiting in the pool and even when there is a water aerobics class, one lane is left open to due laps. Hot tub, sauna, and some inexplicable walk in dunking tub (see, I'm not a gym aficionado or else I would know what that thing is for).

Towel service, locks, and even gym shorts available. (no more using that excuse that you can't work out today because you left your work out clothes at home...they have some to check out there.)

Even the seemingly cranky old lady doing her water workout was nice and called me sweetie and asked if I was ok when I inadvertently let out a puppy like whimper as my shoulder blades decided they wanted to cede from the union of my body. Note to self....don't do a month of the P90X with a friend, think you're hot stuff and on your way to a gym bod and then jump in a pool to do a mile swim without stretching because you think you're all that now. Had it not been for Grandma Water Aerobics, I might still be at the far end of the pool trying to inch my way back to the stairs hoping that the water on my face hid the tears that were going start gushing any minute if I couldn't make it to the hot tub to get my back to stop seizing up.  (Thank you, unknown Water Aerobics lady. You turned a moment of shame into motivation. Oh yeah, I will out swim grandma next time!)

The place is in the basement of an office building next to the seemingly abandoned Chateaux on Central development. Central and....Encanto (?) 
You can park on the street (careful of the meters) or use the garage. The gym validates. 

There is a downstairs weight room (I haven't check it out yet as I because there is a free gym at my job.) Yes, I like this place so much, I am paying for a gym membership even though I have access to work out facilities for free in my own building....including free personal trainer....but instead I get in my car come 5pm and drive to a gym I pay for because this athletic club is worth it. 

I saw no young kids running around. The clientele seems to be early  30s and up, young urban professionals and some retirees who are just trying to stay healthy. No creepy people ogling you (which you may be looking for) and no rude gym bunnies laughing at you in your leotard on the treadmill....but really....you shouldn't have the leotard and hot pink leg warmers on anyway...it is 2010.  But hey, to each his own.",1
"Wow. Wow Freakin' Wow.

I have never, ever had such a perfect dining experience from the minute they greet you, learn your name, cater to your every need, and give you FABULOUS, beautifully prepared food since...well, NEVER. 

I must say I did do my research, so I did know what I wanted to try and even though I kind of expected the JW Marriott to be more of a snooty place, I felt it would be closest to my house and wanted to find out for myself what all the hoopla was about this Roy person and his fish.

I went with my friend Amy who was visiting from New York. She had been to Roy's before and is a fellow foodie. We got to the restaurant early and went outside on the immense patio area to sit and have a drink. It's December so a bit chilly but the HUGE, soft patio furniture was extremely cozy and we sat and had $20 martinis (LOADED with vodka. Warning: We had to ask for more fruit juice! And we are major drinkers - just gotta throw that in there.) Our waitress on the patio could not have been more accomodating and she even brought us new martinis even though we drank quite a bit of our strong ones. I am a people watcher and it was nice to see that there was an assortment of people sitting on the furniture, some of them looked like they could be relatives of mine, enjoying the late afternoon, reading, conversing....well, if I HAD any rich or classy relatives, that is. It was very nice and relaxing. Plus the Mariott property is stunning and I wish I could have looked around the property more than we did.

When we meandered inside for dinner, the hostess greeted us by name and our server showed us to our table. She was very competent, could make recommendations, and was pleasant without being clingy. We loved her. She reminded me of Joan Cusack. Sounded just like her!

The complimentary appetizer of lightly spiced, steamed edamame was delightful and even though they gave us warmed wet washcloths we were complete heathens and ate with our hands without ever using them.

We shared the Roy's Canoe for Two, which had Lobster potstickers, Beef Satay, shrimp on a stick (not its real name), and Tuna Sushi Rolls. I must say - the Lobster potstickers - better than sex. The Beef satay was basically this ultra-tender beef on a stick, lightly flavored and grilled. Fabulous. But the pinnacle of perfection here was the Tuna sushi rolls, which absolutely knocked our socks off. I have never, ever had such an amazing piece of sushi before that moment. I think our  server, Joan Cusack (Not her real name) thought I was choking because as I ate it, my eyes were rolling back into my head in ecstacy.  She bustled over and once she got closer she could see she was merely interrupting a very intimate moment with me and my tuna roll and she went back to her post after giving me a thumbs-up sign. For whatever reason, these tuna sushi rolls were encrusted in what may have been macadamia nuts and it was completely divine. I re-live that moment over and over. MMM.

But you know, the showstopper was STILL yet to come. I could not believe my luck when my Roy's Trio was placed in front of me. It was a piece of Hawaiian butterfish in Miso sauce, a piece of Seared Ahi, and a piece of salmon. The poor salmon! It was the best salmon I ever had out, but next to those two it was like Cinderella's ugly stepsister. Just upstaged by the butterfish, which is melt-in-your mouth decadence, and the seared ahi - which surpassed the tuna roll I just got done fantasizing about as the most perfect piece of sushi EVER.

Amy got the butterfish. We licked our plates clean. Amy tried my Ahi and declared it, like I did, the BEST seared Ahi on the planet.

For dessert, you KNOW I had to have the molten chocolate souffle. How good was it?? Brad Pitt could have walked up naked to our table and I would not have looked up long enough to stop shoveling it into my face.

Amy ordered the 3 creme brulees - one had a Hawaiian orchid on it, and they were not only lovely but they tasted amazing. The coconut one was so fresh and it made me think that THIS is what every coconut cream pie in the world needs to taste like. I think the other flavors are vanilla bean (very good too) and maybe rum? (also very good) 

It may not sound like I am doing the dessert justice but when you've been kissing George Clooney for an hour then along comes Rick Springfield, which one is better? They are both amazing, but by the time Rick comes along, well, you're kind of spoiled already.

Roy's could not have been better - this entire experience was an A++ through and through. 

The staff was extremely helpful (someone walked me to the ladies room when I merely asked where it was) (Oh and need I mention the corwn molding in the bathroom stalls was nicer than the crown molding in my house???) (And you know you are in a classy joint when a basket of tampons and maxi-pads is out on the marble bathroom counter, like party favors for down under)

THUMBS WAY UP!!!",1
"5 stars if you are rich and love to throw your wad around

1 star if you are on a budget and think plastic surgery is terrifying

3 stars if you enjoy window shopping, gawking at the snobbery and mock the fact that some people will spend $3000 on a ugly brown canvas purse with little ""LVs"" printed on it because it makes you feel good about yourself.

4 stars if you go during a mega-sale weekend when the ""normal mall chain stores"" have clearance - (Bath and Body Works, Gap, Express, Dillards etc, but they also have an H&M)

At the end of the day it makes me want to escape to hills where people put value on the important things in life and not what brand your sunglasses are.",0
"I now consider myself an Arizonian. If you drive a lot on the 101 or 51 like I do, you'll get your fair share of chips on your windshield. You'll also have to replace a windshield like I had to do just recently. Apparently, chips and cracking windshields  is common in Arizona. In fact, I seem to recall my insurance agent telling me that insurance companies must provide this coverage in Arizona.

I had a chip repaired about a year ago near the very bottom of the windshield. Just recently a small, very fine crack started traveling north on the windshield from the repaired chip (a different vendor repaired the chip). I called these guys over to my house and they said it was too long to fix, so they replaced the whole windshield the next day.

What great service, they come out to your residence or place of business to repair or replace your windshield.",1
"HARISSA SPICED FRIES. Need I say more? The wine list is exceptional, and they are open late, both of which are mandatory if you're a boozy creature of the night like me.

Our server was quite attentive without being intrusive. Our wine glasses were never dry, and she instinctively sensed that it would be a three bottle sort of night and suggested additional bottles to go with our meal.

The food was of a generous proportion, so bear this in mind when ordering. My Fez Salad was fresh, crisp, and the combination of the dressing and goat cheese hit the spot. Our hummus platter was heaven-sent, and had just the right amount of garlic. The lamb kisra was also exceptional, and immediately devoured. The aforementioned Harissa fries were fiery and I often dream of them. No, really. If Fez was located in Tucson, I would gain at least ten pounds from just eating harissa fries every day. Harissa, for those of you who are unfamiliar, is a North African chili-based spice that has a lovely smoky quality. I highly recommend it!

Well, Fez. I'm in Phoenix next weekend. Prepare yourself for round two.",1
Loved my haircut. Walked in and waited for just a minute. The stylist cut exactly like I wanted and I walked out paying 20 which included the tip.,1
"Humongous flat screen TV!!!! That is the first thing I noticed about the room! Pretty awesome! 

The room is cozy, and a decent size. The king size bed was comfy with fluffy pillows. The living room had plenty of seats that faced the flat screen TV. The room has a mini-fridge and a microwave.

The only gripe about this place is a very small closet and bathroom. There is barely enough room to close the door for the bathroom. The closet also had one sliding door. 

The continental breakfast was average. No hot food. Guests can choose either cold cereal, instant oatmeal, juice and milk, fruit, yogurt, toasts or bagels. The seating area in the kitchen was convenient for guests to enjoy their meal.

If you need access to computers, they are located next to the kitchen. There is a printer as well.",1
"yummy! that's all i have to say about my blazin' buffalo sandwich on foccacia . the foccacia was a perfect specimen: light, appropriately herbed and airy. the sandwich fillings (sliced roast chicken, tomatoes, ranch, lettuce, and buffalo sauce) were fresh and yummy. i had a coupon for a free drink which made my sandwich, chips and a drink $7.47. a pretty awesome lunch for less than $8 makes me happy. almost as happy as buffalo sauce makes me. i have a tendency to be obsessed with buffalo sauce. a word to the wise: my co-workers got pasta salad and it looked awesome. they said it was tasty too. i was jealous. there's no up-charge for pasta salad - i recommend you get that instead of stupid chips you can get at the grocery.",1
"It was a busy bustling little town perched atop a small hill between the mighty Superstition Mountains to the east and the Goldfield Mountains to the west.
   The first gold-strike was made in 1892, and it took just a little under a year before the town came to life. One rich strike after another supported the town and approximately 4000 people who lived in the district for five rich years.
   The town boasted 3 saloons, a boarding house, general store, blacksmith shop, brewery, meat market and a school house. Just when it looked like the town would outgrow Mesa, the vein faulted, the grade of ore dropped and the town died a slow painful death. After several unsuccessful attempts to reopen the mines, the town did come to life again from 1910 on and off until 1926.",1
Ordered spanikopita and Greek salad. Spanny was doughy and Greek salad lacked a kick. Unlike any Greek I'd had before. Not going back.,0
"Thanks to Sara V. I learned about Total Wine & More through her and when i heard they were opening up locations in Phoenix, I was excited. Anywho, 6 visits later, I can honestly say I'm a fan of total wine and moreso than BevMo. I love that there's a wide selection of wines from all over. My favorites are Riesling, Moscato, Rose, Pinot Noirs and sparkling wines. Yes, I love the sweet kinds.

Anywho, my most recent visit, had me buying two kinds of Rieslings both recommended, a Bree and the other one a German Riesling. I recently had Moscato the night before and loved, it was sweet like apple cider and very flavor, with it's apple and peach undertones...simply delish! The Bug Juice Moscato was YUM and elegant. I totally enjoy the selection not just for wines but for beers as well. I like that I can by some hoegardaan for cheap and I like the wine tastings going on. The staff's helpful and overall I like the layout and the prices!",1
"Always good pizza, close to home and they serve beer and wine.  Plus my kids can play video games and husband can watch the game.",1
"I love this place the more I go to it! The service is completely out of the ordinary for fast food and now they have something called, Mexican Gumbo. Holy schneikies it's good!!! Can't beat the prices either! If I had a choice of this place over Chipotle, I would choose Qdoba ANY day!!!",1
"This place has a lot of potential; I really want it to do well. I went there on Saturday night with my husband around 7 pm and it was jam packed. Good for them! We felt a little out of place since it was a much much older crowd, (in bad capris, shorts and flip flops...doesn't anybody make an effort anymore? This part of town, I guess.) Anyway, we had a nice booth, but it was directly across from the pizza oven, so we were quite warm. Pleasant server, good busser/foodrunner keeping our waters filled. We decide to try the Bruschetta for a starter and the Rib-eye dinner for two for $28...an unbelievable price. The Bruschetta was quite good (and at $6 also a good value) and with a nice mozzerella and balsamic drizzle...it was tasty. The Rib-eye's on the other had, were not so nice. But, I must stress, these meals were $14 each...what did I expect? The steaks were large and tough; my husband said his tasted old. Yikes. Mine wasn't that bad, and the potatoes and veggies were flavorful. Our thoughts, under the premise of ""if we were running this restaurant"", are: we would have offered a much smaller but higher quality piece of steak. Food for thought, Javino's. In our opinion, quality over quantity every time.  As we were eating we were able to keep an eye on the drama with the staff...and  watch how hard those boys in the kitchen were working! It was really busy, and they all did seem to work well as a team, manager included. At one point, a sweet, young server comes back with a couple of plates to the manager  (I guess someone sent back there food) and burst into tears. Ah, we felt so bad! I hate it when customers make the server cry and if the food was no good how on earth is that her fault?! Well, major points to the manager who gave her a big hug and went to deal with the table. I was impressed. Also, live music going on... a very nice touch. We left feeling like it was an okay place, I liked better than my husband, but something was just kind of ""off"". Maybe they have an identity crisis? Are they a wine bar or are they trying to be fine dining? Either way, I definitely want to go back again soon to try something else on the menu. If for no other reason than how kind that manager was to the server. I have worked in the industry and have been treated like garbage in the same situation. So, kudos. Your staff looks happy.",0
"I traveled to Phoenix often for work from the early 90's to the late 00's and the first thing I'd do leaving the airport was to hit the Pink Pepper lunch buffet, hence I've never ordered from the menu or had their dinner service, but their lunch buffet was awesome!  Very reasonably priced, including an iced tea.  It may not necessarily be the most authentic Thai food as I think they reduce the heat a bit but the flavors were excellent and the variety was good.  Loved their eggplant dish (can't recall the name) and their crispy chicken with the creamy sauce, and of course the usual curry sauce dishes.

If I'm ever back in Phoenix again the Pink Pepper will be one of the first places I go.",1
"Holy AMAZING.  I went here this past Saturday for a baby shower in one of the private dining rooms and was absolutely blown away by the food.  We had a spread which included Mac & Cheese, Sliders, Chopped Salad, some bread and french fries.  I'm still thinking about those sliders and the french fries.  I can't WAIT to go back and order from the full menu. 

As is par for the Sam Fox course; the decor is over the top.  I need to find out who designs these places and have them make over my house!",1
"PBR. Mad Dog 20/20. What??!! I was a witness to someone drinking Milwaukee's Best Light. Damn son. I guess if youre going to do it, do it cheap.

Get there early if you're going on Saturday morning for the game, it fills up quick. All in all, it is was it is. An Ohio bar, watching football, peeps getting sliggity sloppt. Most are still drunk from the night before. Makes for good people watching practice. Make friends with your neighbors when you find a seat. They could be from Ohio and a new person to be ""besties"" with.

"I called The Town Dump to ask if I could come in this week and interview them for an English paper about a small local business, and the owner was just incredibly rude. She didn't even let me finish telling her it would take five minutes of her time, preferring to interject and tell me to go somewhere else. When I explained that I've heard wonderful things about their business from friends, and that that sparked my interest, she said, ""Well, go somewhere else.""
I've never even been inside, and I sure as hell won't go now. Maybe it's just me, but I don't like shopkeepers who snarl at their customers.",2
"I've visited the Crudo in Old Town and was really excited when the new one opened in Arcadia.  Visited with the bestie a nice quiet weeknight to enjoy some girl time.  You can get a 3 course meal for $35 and pick from salads, meats or what I would call side dishes.  It's a bit pricey for what you get portion-wise, unless you decide to order 3 meats..but who does that?  The wine is very reasonably priced.  The food is amazing!  Everything is cooked and seasoned perfectly, and presented to be delicious.  The decor is very simple, feels like you are in a big open warehouse.  It'd be a great place to have a group dinner for 6-10 as they have these rooms that are a bit more secluded they could put you in.  The service was a bit too good, to the point where we almost felt like she was rushing us even though there was nobody else in the restaurant.  

I'd visit again, but this is definitely a place to take another food loving girl friend- the boyfriend would be hungry and feel ripped off, it's just not his style...",1
"Finally tried the only ""real"" Chinese food restaurant in Maricopa.  Played it safe with Sweet & Sour Chicken, Crab Rangoon, and Pork Fried Rice.  With delivery, it was only $14 +tip.  

The fried rice was great, it was a little more of the ""East Coast"" style I grew up with, dark w/ lots of juicy nuggets of roast pork.  The chicken was good, but then again, it was a (VERY) safe choice, next time I'll try one of the ""Chef's Specialties"".  Crab Rangoon was good, unlike Panda Express, there was crab (krab?) in the cream cheese.  

If you're in Maricopa and craving Chinese, don't go to Panda Express, definitely give Great Wall a try, it's in the same plaza as Panda and if your party is 2 or more, you'll save yourself some money!",1
"I ate here over the weekend while attending Comicon.  I was actually pretty hungover at the time and desperately needed to plug my gut.  It was between this and a deli I saw a little bit down the way but pizza always, always sounds good so I made my decision.  In my mind, in a fight between a pizza and a sandwich, the pizza would always win because it has the power of molten-hot cheese and pepperoni shields.

Yay:  It was like $6 bucks for a big slice of pizza and a salad and a drink.  That's a really, really good deal.  The salad that I got wasn't like an amazing salad but it had onions on it and croutons and had a strong flavor.  It wasn't bad.  If I were a teacher and my class assignment was, ""Throw a salad together super quick and cheap,"" and I got that salad, I'd give it a B.

Nay:  The pizza was not so good.  But, you know, it was pizza and pizza is hard to fuck up so it was salvageable.  The big problem was that it was so greasy.  I mean the pizza sweat grease like a fat man's back.  If I were a teacher and my class assignment was, ""Make me a cheap ass piece of pizza that tastes good,"" I'd give this slice of pizza like a C.  I choked that shit down though and washed it down with salad and raspberry iced tea.

So, you know, the pizza wasn't great, but after I got done eating I felt a lot better.  I had the strength and energy to check out Comicon for the rest of the day.  I geeked out good.",0

I don't know why I haven't updated my review either, so here I go! 


The honey habanero are still my #1 but I also love the Cajun Hot!  Holy Crap!! Get some of the Cajun Hot wings and some ranch and their hot sauce on the side, dip your wing in the ranch and then the hot sauce and watch out!! The only time you really feel the burn is when you're no longer eating, gums & tongue just be blaze hot and mouth just be water for more, yes my friends that's the heat I love!!


Luv me some wings from ATL!",1
"The caramel ones were heaven on earth, but I agree with the other Yelpers that the standard brownie is on the dry side.

I still have quite a few flavors to sample, but from what I have seen so far, they are not worth the price point.",2
"I've never had any real problems with this store.  It is your typical lower income neighborhood grocer.  
What really bugs me about ALL the Fry's stores is their waste with receipts.  Call me a hippy, but more than half of the receipt paper has nothing to do with my purchase.  I buy 1 item and they hand me a receipt 12 inches long!  With all the stores doing that it equates to many thousands of pounds of paper wasted every year unnecessarily!  Hundreds of trees are dying because these guys just don't give a shit.
Ya, ya, I know, it's probably the least of this companies waste issues, but it's one that's handed to me every time I shop there, staring me in the face.  I don't like it and I don't like supporting it.",0
"I work right down the street from Press and have been a huge fan from my very first visit! The staff is unbelievably friendly and extremely passionate about their craft! Everything from the food to the coffee is first rate! They always accommodate my special requests (a little more of this, none of that) and always make good suggestions when I'm looking for something new.
 I love the yogurt and granola parfait (strawberry and vanilla yogurt for me with a bit of honey and light granola) for breakfast with a white chocolate latte. Also, the breakfast burritos are perfectly creative and filling. For lunch, my favorite is the cactus club panini with a small side salad.
 Also worth mentioning is that they have the VERY BEST iced coffee around. They call it an iced toddy and any one of the employees would be happy to tell you how it is different from regular coffee. I just know that it tastes amazing and seems to have a bit more of a caffeine kick!
  My favorite part about Press are their delectable desserts! The berry mascarpone cake pretty much makes you feel like you've won the lottery. And the ghirardelli brownies and chocolate chip cookies (warmed up) are a weekly addiction of mine.
  Starbucks is a thing of the past. I'm lucky to be in close proximity to Press, but I think I would even make the drive just for that mascarpone cake!",1
"In town for our 5 year wedding anniversary.  Sushi is one of our favs, so, after doing some reading on Yelp, off we went to Sakana.

I must agree with many other Yelpers...the nigiri is fantastic!  Huge, tasty pieces of super fresh fish.  I'm craving it now as I'm writing this!  I'm so glad I read the reviews and ordered several items from the nigiri menu...it was fantastic.  

The rolls, while well priced, were a little disappointing.  Maybe it was just our selections, but nothing really jumped out at us...everything was pretty bland.  We asked our server for recommendations and everything was a California roll plus this or that.  Pretty blah.  Even the Mexican Caliente Roll was rather uneventful.

The service was awesome.  Everyone was friendly, efficient, well organized.  The atmosphere was rather mainstream, which was fine with me.  I did have to laugh, as the first song we heard when we sat down was a Pitbull song, which another reviewer bemoaned.  The volume wasn't offensive, so it really only served to make me laugh. 

The customer appreciation menu and Kirin beer special is genius.  So many customer appreciation menus are pretty sparse, but theirs is well fleshed out and offers a lot of options.  We each ordered Kirins while we waited for our table (we were told it would be 15-20 minutes, but it was maybe 5 minutes) and got 2 appetizers for 50 cents each.  Pretty cool.  (The scallop poppers were yummy.  The edemame was, well, edamame.  Not a huge serving, but what do you want for .50?)

All in all, a good dinner.  We know when we go for sushi that it's probably going to be a pricy night.  Not at Sakana...it was probably the best meal we had in Scottsdale at the very best price.  If we're back in town, we will definitely return.  I'll just get more creative in my roll selection...or maybe just stick with the nigiri :)  Yum!",1
I took my son who has been living in Sweden to Angels since he likes good beer.  And he was noy disappointed.  The price was right for the quality of the beer.  We also enjoyed the food I had the sweet potatoe tacos and the were great.  He loved that so many varieties of good beers were on tap.  Definitely going again especially if all three of my son's are home.   Good beer good food good people,1
"I read the reviews on Charleston's and decided to take the plunge even though there were a few negative reviews. I am a visitor to AZ for business and have grown so tired of restaurant food. 

I love salad and find most places don't know how to make a decent salad, the one at Charleston's was so good with fresh tomato and egg and the creamy garlic dressing!! Yummy.

The filet was medium well and I not being a steak fan usually need some type of sauce (except for Ruth/Chris), but this steak was really good. I took my meal to go and couldn't wait to get the hotel because it smelled so good.

Last but not least was the baked potato. The salt on the outside, I quote someone else, ""genius"". 

I used curbside to go - AWESOME.

If you haven't tried this place, go - despite the few bad reviews. I am now a fan and will do something I rarely do - eat the same meal two days in a row (I am not kidding, it was good!!)",1
"We have a show quality teacup Yorkie and a 5 Pound Maltese, who has issues, and they handle them beautifully! The owners attitude is all about making sure you are happy and your dogs are too! We were using a place across the street where the owner was all about taking your money and then booking you with who ever was available, even if you had an appointment with a particular groomer! These guys are the best, they CARE, and it's a pleasure to give them our business. Just Go!!!! :-)",1
"You get a lot of food thats what I love! The guy was very very helpful although you know sometimes you just want a minute to think, that was noexisitant. The chicken is realld good, the ribs were better than okay, but not great. The beef was kinda salty. All in all though great bang for your buck!",1
Pho-k yeah .......and the spring rolls too ........,1
"Food middle of the road... The staff is rude.. Seems like it starts with the owner. I think she makes the staff pay for everything that goes wrong so in turn they dont want to fix issues with poor, wrong food etc.  I think she tends to forget the customers are actually what keeps a business open. For a long time it was the only choice in the area. Now there are multiple choices.  If your in the area Chili's or Connolys is much better choice in my oppinion.",2
"I love Scottsdale Child Care & Learning Centers. My daughter started going there when she was 10 months old. The teachers are wonderful. Not only are they nurturing and kind they are also very interested in each child. 

My Daughter  has been attending for 6 months now and has graduated to room 2 for toddlers. She knows over 30 words and I attribute much of that to Scottsdale Child Care. She has loved all her teachers and welcomes with open arms each morning when I drop her off. 
I would recommend this center to any parent, especially if you are nervous about leaving your loved one for the first time.",1
Jake's been taking care of our cars for almost 7 years. He's very trustworthy and fair.,1
Good for an easy and leisurely business lunch or outing with the girls.  The market downstairs is great for takeout and a great selection of bakery treats.,1
"LOVE LOVE LOVE the ambience outside! Love the fact the restaurant is in a old style bungalow and the patio is lit with string lights.

I went there for the first time last night 15min before close and I dont know if they usually have music or not..but if they don't, they need it. 

Food was great but nothing to die for.",1
"I liked them a lot until I had to call them to get the discount fare for the toddler but since I was booking our tickets together (because a two year old legally can't fly alone so I HAD to) on the phone, I wasn't getting the lower internet rate.  That's extortion!  I'd much rather do the entire thing on the internet.  Then he tells me that the child's fare goes off of the regular rate which is only one dollar less than the internet rate.  What the hell?  Why would I ever want to sit on hold for 25 minutes to book a flight to get this crap?  Then they tried to get me to pay $15 more for the next class up (I know, upper class on Southwest - strange).  I asked what I got:  1.25 times the miles (yeah, you heard right 25% more - that's going to get me far), first boarding and a free drink.  I clarified that with a child I get to board first anyway (they confirmed this).  Then I asked how much a drink costs.  $5.  So essentially they are asking me to pay $15 instead of $5 for a drink I may or may not want (then again, I'm traveling with a child so who am I kidding, I'm going to need a drink).  And to top it all off, they tell me we can't do on-line check in because Beckham doesn't have a picture ID.  I tell them but he does have a picture ID.  He has a passport, in fact he has two.  The Southwest person tells me no one has two passports so I tell him that no, it's true.  The toddler and I both have two as we have dual citizenship.  (Not that we would need them to fly to California so the whole conversation is entirely pointless now.)  The Southwest man being the all-knowing scholar he is tells me that's impossible and illegal.  I take a deep breathe, tell him he's right, I'm wrong, how stupid I am.  I must be thinking of my library card.    Why are things so difficult sometimes?",2
"It is absolutely no fun to have a connection at this airport! It was definitely  not designed to be ""post-911"" friendly. Let me give you an example so that you will know what I mean: 

We fly in from San Francisco and are told that we will have to go to another building via a bus. We get off the plane and walk...and walk...and then walk some more, looking around trying to find where to go to in order to catch this bus. Finally, we found someone who told us where to go. We walked and walked, and then walked some more until we finally caught the bus. We then had to find the correct gate and go through security again... 

Flash forward 8 days. We fly in and go through customs. (This, BTW, was a great experience because we were the only international flight going through customs.) We rechecked our luggage and are told that we have to go to another building. Yep, you know what I am about to say...we floundered around, having to ask where to go several times. Finally, we found the right place and got on the bus. It then proceeded to go to various parking lots, dropping off and picking up other passengers. My husband and I looked at each other, worried that we were on the wrong bus. Since it was already 4 p.m. and we had not had lunch, we were getting very worried that we would not have time to grab lunch. 

Finally, my husband asked the driver and he indicated that we were indeed on the right bus. We continued going around parking lots until we came upon another bus. The driver told everyone on our bus that we could sit around and wait for 10-15 minutes, or we could get on the next bus and get there quicker. Of course, we all grabbed our suitcases and boarded the next bus, which proceeded to take us to the correct stop (after picking up additional passengers along the way.) 

Next ,we entered the terminal and jumped on an elevator to take us to the security line. There were only 2 lines and of course, we got in the line with the family who had to go back 6 or 7 times because they kept trying to go through the security line with belts on, shoes on, liquids in  their suitcases...you get the picture! 

Anyway, we finally got to our gate and were able to grab a slice of pizza before boarding our plane (not before enduring the antics of a 70-year-old United Airlines power-hungry granny who couldn't seem to get her act together, but was determined to show everyone who was boss...)",0
"Four Peaks baby.  This spot is awesome.  Great place to meet up with a crowd, grub, and pound some craft brew.  The food is great: dope appetizers , rockin' burgers, decent pizza, and daily specials.  The beer is fantastic, hop knot being my fave.  They have happy hour everday from 3-7 and 10-close with dollar off beers, a light night menu, TV's, and a pool table.  I've gotten mashed here more than a few times.  Sunday brunch is killer, and may I suggest you try the Stout milkshake, a little known secret, but good for the sweet toof.  Don't miss out on the Peaks.",1
"Spring Rolls - Great!  Singapore Noodles - Great!  Hot & Sour Soup - not so great - I have never had a hot and sour soup so dark!  Although the hot was hot and the sour, was sour - a little bit goes a very long way!

Definitely going back again, just skipping the hot & sour soup next time.",1
"There are few things I cannot stand more than eating out for pizza-by-the-slice. Those are: slices so big they contain an entire days worth of calories and charging additional for traditional toppings. 

While I understand the appeal of this centralized pizza joint -- a slice is 1/4 the pizza itself. The crust is a couple inches high and the pizza itself is barely 1/4 inch. I had cheese and while cheese pizza isn't remarkable as is, the slice I had here was considerably unimpressive.

We paid $9.31 for 2 slices and a 20 oz beverage. 

What also put me off to this place was the cold staff and multiple things did not seem to be working right while there -- including their ice machine and their sound system (cut on and off). I was also not impressed how, never truly hearing of Sal's before, the employee made it seem like a chain of few. Go to their website and you will realize otherwise. This location is franchised.

I will not return (unless I am not paying). Instead, I will take a jab at one of the other multiple fast food options on that corner.",2
"The food leans toward the SouthWest and is located near Old Scottsdale.  The place has a couple of patios as well as couches/easy chairs for seating.  Large curved bar with televisions.  Tons of tequila.The place tends to be busy because of its location, however the food is nothing special - burgers, wraps, tacos, etc.  Prices are steep considering what you get.  Service can be spotty depending on time of day.",2
"Jason B. and I decided to try this place on Saturday night. I looked at the menu online and though the food sounded really interesting.

We started with the Artichoke Croquettes, and the Calamari as well. We were disappointed in the Artichoke Croquettes, you get 4 half Artichokes fried with alternating Marinara and this white sauce. The only thing that was good about this dish was the white sauce, which we used to dip the Calamari in. The Calamari was your average calamari, nothing special! 

I ordered a the 19th Street Burger, which was cooked perfectly and came with a spicy sauce, not sure if the sauce was for the Onion Rings, but it was great of the Burger.

Not sure I will be rushing back to the Armadillo Grill, but I wouldn't say no to going back again!",0
"We had a great time. Had bottle service with Katie. who was super friendly. Our drinks were never empty, and that was nice because we were celebrating a birthday. The music and atmosphere were great.",1
"All of the restaurants are excellent:  Houston's, Bandera, Rutherford Grill (Napa), and Los Altos Grill.  Service has been excellent every time.  All the food is excellent, however make sure you get the Tortilla Soup if available.  The ribs, french dip, and hot fudge sundae are great too.",1
"It's rare that I have a date with my husband on a Monday afternoon/evening, but this past Memorial Day, we did just that.  After a quick visit to the Science Center (the Van Gogh alive exhibit is a must-see by the way), we were hungry so we headed over to Rice Paper.  Neither of us had ever been before, and we were pleased with our experience.

It was a tad bit too hot to sit outside, although they do have a covered patio with misters.  We walked in and were seated and greeted promptly by Al, our server.  He's quite the character.  He made us laugh quite a bit in addition to being attentive and making some recommendations.  We enjoyed the stylish renovated house / hip colorful atmosphere as well.

We ended up ordering a few things and sharing.  Highlights included the firecracker shrimp. a spider roll, a shrimp roll, and a zen salad.  Everything was light and tasted fresh.  We really enjoyed the dipping sauces that came with the spring rolls.  They've got such a huge selection of the spring rolls, that I can't wait to return to try some of the others.  They don't have a huge selection of Vietnamese entrees, but it appears that they will custom create a bit upon request.

I highly recommend going for the ""food happy hour.""  It's from 3pm - 6:30pm and includes $6 appetizers & $1 off all spring rolls.  Such a deal!  We didn't take advantage of it, but the ""drinks happy hour"" is actually 11am - 6:30pm and specialty drinks are $6, house wine by the glass is $5, well drinks are $4, and draft beer is just $2.75.

If only Rice Paper was a tad bit closer to home, I could see myself being a regular... Instead, I'll keep it high on my list of spots to return to when I find myself heading downtown!",1
"This would typically be a 3 star review, but it gets another star for the following:

* Great air conditioning
* Arizona's only Neiman Marcus
* Hilarious people watching
* Great happy hour haunts in the basement
* Everyone here has a better tan than I do  

Scottsdale Fashion Square is large and in charge and is definitely a sprawling spectacle to see at least once.   There's no denying that it's a local institution -- even if the store mix is a bit too pricey and exclusive for some.",1
"Walk the other way, just walk right the hell the other way...

Here was how this played out.  Oktoberfest a few days ago.  Starting the night off.  I walk past this place and see a place that sells a slice of pizza for $1.99.  Good, right?  No.  

me: ""Hi, one slice of pizza please""
guy: ""you buy drink with it, 4 dollars.""
me: ""no, just one slice of pizza""
guy: ""we do not sell one slice, you have to buy a drink.  4 dollars""

I should have pulled a flag on this play at this point, but knowing I was going to be drinking I move forward wanting food in me. Not a wise move.

me: ""so, I can't buy one slice?""
guy: ""no, you buy a drink with slice, 4 dollars.""
me: ""It doesn't say that anywhere on the menu or walls""
guy: ""No, do not sell one slice.
me: ""what the... O.K., give me 2 slices of pizza""
guy: ""you buy two slices then.""
me: ""yes, Jesus Christ, yes""
guy: ""toppings?""
me: ""no, no toppings.  cheese.""
guy: ""we have toppings.""

what is this guy, fucking deaf? 

me: ""no thanks""

I give him the money.

guy: ""it take 10 minutes, you wait.""

I don't think they run the air conditioner in this place, so I wait outside.

Pizza comes out.  Tastes like absolute crap.  I eat it outside because in September in Chandler Arizona it is cooler outside then inside this place.  I think they had the thermostat set to ""HELL"" Guy working or running the place comes outside and stares me down as I am eating.  I'm sure if you want to eat here you can check the dumpster for plenty of slices to try beforehand to avoid having to pay for one.  Excuse me, avoid having to pay for two.  However after what I had served to me I'm pretty sure they will beat you to the garbage cans and sell it back to some other unsuspecting soul.  I was the only one dumb enough to finish all the food.  Wouldn't eat here if there was a natural disaster and this place was the last to be ransacked for provisions.  I'd keep walking.

FAIL.",2
"Lunch review:  
Great quick lunch options. I'm a big fan of the lunch salads.  They are very filling (paired with the free chips and salsa!!)  My favorite is the Chipotle Chicken Salad (Mixed lettuce, black beans, roasted corn, cheese mix, pico de gallo topped with grilled chicken)-- it's only $6.99.  The spunky chipotle dressing is delish.  There are also several lunch-sized versions of dinner plates available for diners looking for a heartier meal.  The service is always friendly and were are able to get in and out in less than an hour, which is very convenient during a busy work day.",1
"there is one problem with bagel nosh: it's not close enough to tempe! went there on a sunday a little before closing-the bagel selection was sparse but they offered to get us any kind of bagel we wanted. the garlic,feta, and dill cream cheese was amazing and the breakfast sandwich looked hella yummy! went to get a refill on our way out and the owner offered a free large glass of iced tea since they were about to close. the service was great andi might have to make the trip out there very soon!",1
"I was very disappointed in my encounter with them today.  I have been going there for years and thought they have done a good job.  Today I picked up my Tori Burch purse that I brought in to have a shoulder strap repaired.  The thread they used for the repair was a light cream color.  The purse and the stitching is a mustard yellow color.  It looks terrible!!!  They tried putting some cream colored shoe polish on the tread, no improvement.  Now the thread just looked dirty.  I told them that I was not at all happy with the repair.  They just kept saying in thick accent.  ""It's good, I fixed it good"".  They would not refund the amount I prepaid,  (prepay only store), or redo it with the correct color thread.  Just kept saying.  ""I fixed it good"".  Looks like I'll be finding a new shoe repair place.",2
"My prom date brought me here 10 years ago. Hmm...I wonder what he was expecting at the end of the night. Although he thought that tanning until he was as red as a lobster was the new black this was one of his better judgment calls.  

We had a window seat and I mesmerized him with fascinating facts about the city, which were on little plaques along the windows. It really took him until the end of dinner to figure it out. Anyway, I am sure the menu has changed, but the salad and shrimp with angel hair pasta I had that night were yummy. Cool view. I will have to come back sometime to see how the valley has changed from this view.",1
"This place was AMAZING!  I have stayed in probably over 100 hotels, this one was the BEST hotel I have ever been to... staff was extremely friendly, I WILL be back!",1
"I'm so sad I didn't discover the Herb Box sooner. I went for a girl's lunch and was blown away - by the decor, the vibe, the view and the food - and this was during the winter. I can't wait for patio weather because this will become a weekend go-to spot for me. The salads and sandwiches are delicious and the fries and chips - holy moly! They're amazing and you'll get tons of them. The decor is perfectly shabby chic with a traditional twist and I could seriously move in. 

If you and your mom and girlfriends love the quaint feel of Arcadia Farms, give Herb Box a whirl. It's got the same feel, but more modern. Love love love it.",1
"I finally made it to this place after hearing nothing but great reviews from others.  Now I can see why it is held in such high regard.  If you are a fan of Paradise Bakery, this place is better...hands down.  At first glance, it appears to be identical, but on closer look it wins in two important categories.  First, the vast menu blows away the Paradise selection of ""like 3 items""  There are countless sandwhiches, salads, soups and deserts.  Second of all, the prices are incredible.  It is very affordable for the quality and quantity of food.  Finally, the food is excellent.   Not that I have a problem with Paradise, but given the choice, Wildflower wins every time..",1
"My husband & I are addicted to Cherryblossom's ramen. Mr. T is Japanese & I lived in Japan for @4 years, so take my word it's authentic.

The mix of foods is not so strange if you're familiar with restaurants in Japan. The ramen is Hakata style, made with a pork broth & may be heavy/oily for some people, so why not please everybody? Be sure to ask for ""Cha Shu Ramen"" to get a few more pieces of pork. (extra $)

The salads are also fantastic; warm lightly fried (10?)Shrimp on a fresh spring mix base with mango dressing,  Shanghai Duck salad, and the Chicken Caesar was perfect, not heavily dressed like some ""roadhouses."" 

Mr. T & our daughter loved the Eggplant in Miso Sauce, & even the California Roll was good.

It's said Japan took the best of each country's cuisine. So there are French pastries, German beer, Italian pasta, and Indian curries. Save the banana bread for dessert if you can, or get one of their pastries. I've never have enough room.

If you like good WHITE bread, buy one of the Pullman loaves on the table by the front door. My first extra 20 pounds in Japan came from the good bread! (No whole grain breads were available 30 years ago!)

I think it's too small for groups over six.

Maybe we'll see you there.

Added 11/18/07
I think that their menus are not all alike, so if  ramen isn't on the menu you receive, you can still order it. (It's posted in Japanese on the wall.) For the basic, ask for ""Hakata Ramen."" For extra pork, ask for ""Cha-shu-men"" or ""Cha-shu-ramen.""
Either way, there's really not much pork in it. That's why you need a delicious shrimp or duck salad.",1
In my ongoing search for great Chinese food in Phoenix this place is a speed bump,2
"Some highlights
- Loved the special of the day: red velvet pancakes breakfast with cream cheese topping. YUM YUM YUM
- Corned beef hash is canned and not homemade :( sad face
- Fried Chicken breakfast is a huge portion- tasted really well but definitely sad that they only have sausage gravy. Would love it if they could offer a non pork gravy for the non oink eaters. 

Overall, it was delicious, simple menu, great service (Thanks to Waitress Kelly she was really nice) and would much rather support local eateries than Ihop or Denny's anyday.",0
"What can I say except that Jodi is incredible. I had purchased an online deal because I've always wanted to do something like this and thought it to be a great gift for my other half. I sent her a message and she quickly responded. Almost everything I needed to know for the shoot was emailed to me. You have the opportunity to do your own hair and makeup or have someone she works with do it at a reasonable rate. I highly recommend that you get it done by her ladies. That day I saw Erica. She was really fun and got me into the mood (the glass of wine helped too :-) ) and she did an incredible job with the makeup and hair. For those who feel a little nervous I do recommend bringing some wine along with you. It really loosens you up a bit and allows you to be more comfortable. It was perfect since my first photos were the nude shots. Note: wear loose fitting clothing, nothing elastic and be sure that you do not have a sunburn on your body. Let your hair air dry and it is OK to put on your own serums and moisturizers prior to the shoot. Make sure nothing with sunscreen gets on your face and while it's not necessary, I made sure to use a primer. I thought it really helped out with how my makeup set. Be prepared to pose in positions that may be a bit awkward and also note that you will likely be sore the next day from the different twisting that you have to do. Jodi really knows how to make you feel comfortable and at ease. I don't make a habit of being in the buff in front of complete strangers and for me to drop my robe without feeling shy was a big deal for me. It helped that I had my own music mix on my iPod throughout the entire shoot as well. The overall whole experience was incredible. I felt sexy and confident. I went back with my honey to look at the photos. He really really liked them and had a hard time choosing which he wanted to go into the album. I can't wait to see everything finished. I can't wait to do it again :) Thank you Jodi for making it such a memorable experience. I highly recommend her and her ladies!!!",1
"This place is great.  A nice little ole' fashion homemade ice cream place that looks like it has been there for forever.  The place has a real nice vibe to it.  Sorta reminds me of Sugar Bowl only smaller, not as busy, and easier parking.

The menu is ginormous.  I couldn't decide what to get but that didn't matter because the other 3 people I went with chose for me.  I wanted something basic but they insisted on sharing the 'patte' thing.  It is a few scoops of ice cream over a brownie and topped with whip cream and caramel.  While it was very good it just wasn't what I wanted.  Next time I'm just going to get a scoop or 2 of the ice cream so I can really taste what the ice cream is all about.  It is just too difficult to tell when it is topped with a bunch of stuff.  The ice cream we got on the brownie though (butter brittle I think) was excellent.  They have tons of different flavors and they all sound delish!

Anyway I can't wait to go back if I am ever in the area again and need a sugar rush!",1
"I'm on the constant hunt for good Chinese food in Phoenix. After many disappointing meals, I found Desert Jade and haven't looked back. The restaurant is super clean and quaint inside (even a big fireplace) and the service is great. Each of our servers have been super friendly and attentive. The food is really good. It's not going to blow you away, but it's fresh, portions are just right and I've never left unsatisfied. 

I really like the Kung Pao Chicken, the Mu Shu Pork, Spicy Chicken with Vegetables (lots of them), and my husband loooves the glazed walnut shrimp.

If you're looking for an easy, casual Chinese meal in Phoenix - I promise you this is one of your best bets.",1
"Sometimes, a girls wants to splurge on going to the hair salon and sometimes, there is not enough time or money to do that. That is what I love about Great Clips. For the most part, I can stop in and be seen within 5 minutes like today and get a $13 haircut. You can't beat it. Most of the time, I just need the end of my layers cleaned up and why would I want to spend $60 on a haircut to do that?  I have never had any problems with not getting what I wanted. Sometimes, I'll also spend the extra $20-$25 and have them shampoo and blow-dry my hair straight. My hair always looks great when I do that, too. Today, I spent $38 on the cut, shampoo and blow-dry. The blow-dry took alot longer than I wanted today, but Keeyla (sp?) also took the flat-iron to it. Clearly the girl takes pride in her work and my hair looks really great for someone with very coarse, wavy hair. Every once in awhile you can get coupons for an $8 haircut in the mailers. They also give you a free haircut after 11 or 12. I haven't hit that milestone yet but I'll get there. The employees also seem really happy and the girl who did my hair today said alot of them have been there for at least 3 years. She said they love working there and I think it shows with the amount of regulars they get and their positive attitudes.",1
"Great theatre! Super clean and nice sound in all theatres. Only caveat: I can read the prices on the beverage and popcorn menu sign thing, so when I order a medium, I want a medium, I can see that for 50 cents more I can get the large. I just don't want to pee myself when I get caught up in a good flick. But thanks anyway.",1
"The food is fairly good.  That's why it's such a shame that the service sucks!  Every time I have gone there, they take forever to bring you water, take your order, bring out food, everything - even when you are the only people in the entire place.  They are always unfriendly.  Out order has been incorrect on a couple occasions.  I really wish they had better service.  I just won't go there anymore because of that.",2
Nice location. Good outdoor dining. Moms Pot roast good and so are sausage ravioli. Interesting drinks an some local beers. I need to check out The Bliss Burger soon.,1
"Lee's Sandwiches has always been a pleasant place to go since it opened in Chandler years ago. From what I remember it was cheap and delicious. When I went back today, I found it to be cheap in a different way, as well.

I ordered the #17 (Jambon and Pork) on a croissant and a large thai iced tea with no ice. 2 items, $9. Not quite the Lee's I remembered. They called my number and I walked up to get my food. Croissant sandwich, check. No ice in my drink, check. Thai iced tea...half check. My large cup was only half full (not being optimistic). Quite literally half full. I picked up my cup and asked where the rest of my drink was and was told that I ordered no ice (well duh). I told him I didn't order ""no drink"" and he said he wouldn't give me what I paid for.

Very very disappointed. The only thing that saved Lee's from 1 star was the delicious sandwich.

Food - 4 stars
Customer service - no stars",2
I didn't try any food hear but this place seems like it has a split personality. Tons of tvs showing sports so sports bar. At the same time there's a dj blasting club music. There weren't that many people dancing. We went here because the place next door had a huge line. One plus is that theres a second bar near the patio that we stuck by. This place to me was...meh.,0
"My sweet hubby brought me here for my b-day the other night.  Note, this is a Scottsdale 5 star, otherwise known as a Chicago, California, or New York 4 star rating.  This may possibly be my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.  Amazing food.  Unpretentious and cozy atmosphere.  Got the steak frites.  Asked for veggies instead of frites and ended up with steak green beans.  It was excellent.  We asked for a smooth red wine.  I had possibly my second best red wine ever.  We also ordered a scallop appetizer and the escargots.  Both were cooked almost to perfection - however lacking in salt for my personal preference, which is an easy fix.   I would definitely go back.  Don't recommend this for large parties.  However, it is the perfect place for smaller, intimate parties.",1
Was an interesting way to spend an hour.  Lots of displays but very dusty on the inside of the cases.  Quite and peaceful; a nice place to hang out for awhile.  I showed up about 40 minutes before closing and she didn't charge me the $2 but I donated $3 since they operate only on donations.  The table set with rocks and minerals was fun to check out.  I would go back again when I wasn't short on time and explore upstairs.,0
"I LOVE Chic Nails!

I used to go to Tip & Toes on 48th street and Ray Road, until one day they were ""too busy"" to take my friend and I in for pedicured. We discovered Chic Nails and have been doing all of our manicures and pedicures there since. 

The staff is extremely friendly and they give the best pedicures for a very reasonable price. I highly recommend this nail salon over any other!

P.S. It is extremely close to CK's Bar & Grill to go for happy hour after! :)",1
"Where else can you go in Chandler the will transport you to another country for free in a flash!!

I like to shop here and explore the foods of other countries.  This is not just an Oriental Supermarket, they are a World Market.  Each aisle jets you to a different culture or country.

I wish most of all their sake selection was better but oh well, they are bound by the limitations of their distributors.

I will be there again soon for a mini-staycation!!!!",1
"There was hair in the food. Not just 1 but 2 in the same Bhel Puri dish.

The whole experience was pretty bad. There is no indication of how you order your food and when you finally figure it out the food does not taste good. We checked sodas on the order sheet and when no sodas showed up we asked if we were supposed to go and find our own sodas from the front of the store and were told that that was the case.

Also the guy at the counter is down right dismissive.

Pani Puri was OK
Papdi Chaat - boring, no flavor
Bhel Puri - boring and no flavor before we found the hairs

Not worth the trip.",2
"Perfect location for breakfast before SF Giants spring training game. Also, Perfect location for drinks and snacks after the game. Enjoyed 3 meals in two days and will recommend to all my friends.",1
"I've never actually eaten in the restaurant - Swaddee is one of those places I used to pick up and take home when I lived in Chandler. So, first their take-out process: they've never botched an order, food has been ready within the time frame given each and every time, and I'm almost always in and out in a flash. The food: I've sampled various veggie and seafood options, and they've all been equally delicious. Since I've never been inside for more than a few minutes, I can't really vouch for the atmosphere or the service, but I stand by the food. A little pricier, perhaps, than the Thai Basil down the street, but totally worth it.",1
"Everything here is awesome! I love the Kung Pao shrimp and the Hong Kong soup which has wontons and and egg noodles they make in house. The soup they bring out before your meal is delicious as well. Everything tastes made to order, always fresh never greasy, and is presented beautifully. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Definitely try this place! It's a regular lunch spot for my office. They also have great lunch specials. :)",1
"Although the boba here is decent (The Street on Dobson&Southern is better), I really just go here for the food.  The small menu consists of meals that are authentically Taiwanese.  The beef noodle soup ($5) is my favorite.",1
"It seems to be a constant challenge to find a bar and restaurant in the east valley that is not only NOT a chain but that also has a great atmosphere, an attentive wait staff, a fabulous wine list, and a unique food selection (without being too out of the ordinary).   Vintage 95 has all of these!  Not to mention how refreshing it was to deal with a hostess, Jocelyn,  that wasn't 16 years old and actually knew what she was doing!  When we were seated our waitress, Emily was friendly, knowledgeable, attentive,  and never rushed us.  The wine list is extensive, however, I think they should add more low range wines in the $25-$35 range to their list.   The warm and cozy decor of the place makes you want to stay and eat and drink for hours.  The outdoor patio in the back has a great fire pit and romantic lighting.  I HIGHLY suggest making a reservation or you could be waiting a long time for a table.  There was a problem with one of our entrees and the manager took care of it immediately.  I look forward to my next visit to Vintage 95.",1
"Trendy, Current, and a young 20s crowd. You know its trendy when you see all the waitress' in black fish net tights and short black dresses. 

You dine while they play a great music selection with lights all over! Its like eating at a lounge right before the place turns into a night club. Very city-like. 

Come for Happy hour!! I came here with 3 other classmates: Angela, Julie, and Natalie. When they said happy hour for sushi, I was thinking a low key place that was A-OK. I was completely wrong. This place is trendy and hip, which is unlike the suburbia of Mesa. 

During happy hour, my friend and I split the Calamari, Calamari Sushi Roll, chicken wings (6 pieces) and a Margarita, and it came out to $22. Not bad! I like the ambiance, and its definitely something I will be coming back to!",1
"Love Love LOVE Baker's Nursery!!  Been going there since I was a child thanks to my grandparents (my grandad and uncle used to do roofing work for the owners decades ago). 

Seriously...this place is FANTASTIC and the people who work there are AWESOME!  

Want to know what plants/trees you have in your yard?  Bring in a leaf or bark sample and they'll tell you.  Found out we have Chinaberry trees(messy!), Lantana (evil and will not die!), 2 Trumpet vines (attracts hummingbirds!) and a Texas Sage bush (beautiful purple flowering bush) in our yard. 

Want to know what type of tree would do well in your yard?  Just ask!  

Need something transplanted?  Buy the pots and they'll replant your plants for you.  

Buy a sad looking clearance plant from another local store, they'll tell you how to nurse it back to health.  

I could easily wander around Bakers for hours, except during the heat of the day in the summertime!  :)",1
"I was not in a hurry to visit Humble Pie due to the mediocre reviews here.  The hubs and I eventually decided to stop in for dinner after a friend recommended it and I'm so glad we did.  

The vibe at Humble Pie on 7th is definitely good, perhaps due to its proximity to the alterna/artsy Coronado hood.  Relaxed, cool people, good atmosphere and tasty food.  We decided on drinks (a beer for the hubs and some tasty tempranillo for me) and ordered a large salad and a pizza to split.  Our server was great, always making sure our glasses were full and we were happy.  The salad was tasty and our arugula pizza was so good.  Who knew arugula on pizza would be so yummy?  While I was a tad disappointed when I didn't find something super chocolatey on the menu for dessert, the apple crisp topped with vanilla ice cream was delicious.   

We've since been back for drinks and pizza at the bar.  The bar tender was very attentive and friendly and the brick oven pizza was delish.  

Humble Pie a nice place to relax and unwind with good drinks and food.",1
"I've been going here many years.

The food is always very, very good. Soups are fantastic, sandwiches are hearty and flavorful, and the service is excellent. Prices are reasonable and the food quality and quantity is probably the best bang for the $ you'll get in a place like this, anywhere I've been - and I travel a lot.

I really cannot think of a single thing I can fault this place for.",1
I love Petco! The only place I go to get dog food. I feel like the employees generally know what they are talking about and are always willing to help!,1

Dateline 7 May 2009
Scottsdale, Arizona

    Yelpers Jim W and Audrey W were reportedly seen enjoying lively conversation and delicious Indian food with Donald S and Carin S.  Witnesses claim the group was laughing loudly at times.  One bystander reported, ""That was a guffaw.  That outburst right there was definitely a guffaw.  Wild stuff.""

    Sources have related to this publication that the group dined on two appetizers, one known as a bread basket which consisted of four types of naan bread.  Jim W was overheard to say, ""I really like the onion naan.""  The other appetizer may have been Aloo Tikki.  This has not been confirmed as yet.  In any case the plate containing the reported Aloo Tikki was cleaned by the foursome, several even going so far as to swab at the remaining sauce on the plate.

    The above sources also reported that the table was served an order of the Friday daily special of Kahari Shrimp.  It was overheard by a nearby table that the shrimp was ""...flavorful with strong notes of garlic and ginger.""  This has not substantiated, however.

    Audrey W reportedly was served the Lamb Korma which she was rumored to have noted was ""Yummy.""

    Carin S apparently was served the Chicken Masala and Donald S may have been served some sort of Vindaloo that included potato.  It seems there was considerable sharing of the dishes around the table and the main dishes may have been spooned over what some experts have suggested was a basmati rice with various herbs and spices.

    An unnamed source has informed this publication that while Jim W claims to have particularly enjoyed the food and festive atmosphere which included a belly dancer and some swordplay, he was displeased with the excessive sound level produced by the in-house sound system and even requested that the music be reduced.

    Jim W's blog had a statement this morning that read, in part; ""...ears haven't hurt the next morning like that since my last rock concert.  I really liked the food but I wouldn't go back on a night when they have dancing again.""",1
"Love Belly Rubz!! At first little Oscar was timid about me dropping him off but when I came to pick him up he didn't want to quit playing! He has really bad separation anxiety and hates kennels, so it is always worrisome when we try a new groomer. He loved playing and came out looking so handsome! We will be returning to Belly Rubz this week for some more play time and grooming!",1
"This place isn't bad. The place is pretty big in size and I love that they have a drive-thru. I like coming here on the weekends, especially when I need to study, particularly in the vault. Some times they have live music, which can be good or bad, depending on if you're there to study or hang out. They have decent coffee, not the best, but not awful. And I'd prefer to go here over Starbucks any day.",0
"Food was tasty. I ordered the veggie combo, and was a little disappointed that it didn't come with more of a variety of things, especially for $12. BUT what it did come with was good.",0
"I am slightly confused as to what this place is.
Is it a coffee shop? yes.
Is it an ice cream parlor? well..yes.
Is it an antechamber for the hair salon upstairs? kinda.
Seemingly the Pink Spot *giggle* is trying to be a few things at once, and vaguely succeeding at those goals.
I like the Pink Spot *giggle* for a number of reasons:
-location
-convenience
-ambience
-selection
In all honestly it isnt the best coffee shop that the area offers, but It's another option- and that my friends, is a corner stone of capitalism: consumer choice.
Now I won't be making the Pink Spot *giggle*, my local haunt, that spot belongs to Lola, and I would never cheat on my beloved tranny. But for those special nights when I get the strange urge for simultaneous brain freeze and a scalded tongue, i'll go down on the Pink Spot...*giggle*",0
"Do Not Eat Here if you think a bathroom in any way has anything to do with the cleanliness of the food preperation.  There was literally dried smeared feces on the toilet seat and the floor looked like it had never been washed.  Of course the restroom cleaning check-list was not initialed the entire day. Oh...I almost forgot there were no paper towels to dry my hands.  I told one of the employess and he says ""I know dude"".  It's rediculous that the bathroom looks like this when you have 10 employess standing around with their thumbs up their asses gossiping. 

Burger was over-priced.  Milkshake was ok.  Also no napkins anywhere in sight on the tables or at the bar area.  Apparently napkins are something you have to ask for?  Whoever owns this place needs to get a better manager at this facility, because he is loosing money with all of the one-time customers who will choose to go somehwere else next time.",2
"Great selection, TONS of flavor, always hot and fresh, nice staff, great prices. In my top 3 quick restaurants.",1
Great food at a great price. Not the best Italian food but definitely a step up from all of the national chains. Also great lunch prices,1
I love sakana. They have the best lunch time happy hour! Its always delicious and seriously reasonably priced. :),1
"The staff was great, from the owner Bruce meeting you at the door to the bartender Sharon the friendliness of the staff stuck out. 

I had the T.T. Burger which had cheddar, sauteed onions and remoulade. The burger was excellent, and the coleslaw was great. I am not a slaw fan, but this slaw with Bruce's mom recipe  that included vinaigrette was wonderful. My only complaint may have been the fries were slightly overcooked for my taste, but I would go there again.",1
"Some say you get what you pay for  (with an implication of regret) . But with ASMT, you get what you pay for and you actually walk out happy. An hour massage for $12.50?  Tell me where else can you get such good deal?",1
I love this place. A little on the pricey side but the food is awesome and the staff is always cool.,1
"I went to Blanco Tacos + Tequila in Scottsdale with my family for my birthday dinner. This is another one of Sam Fox's restaurants, and it serves up modern Mexican fare. Our party of five all got a ton of food that definitely required to-go boxes throughout the meal.

The atmosphere at Blanco totally didn't surprise me, considering it's a Fox eatery. There was the open kitchen, huge hanging lights, centrally located bar and airy feel. It was chic and dimly lit with candlelight, but there were televisions throughout broadcasting football games. It was a great mix of casual and fancy, making it the type of place where it's perfectly acceptable to go and just down a couple margaritas, or have a fun dinner date.

I started with the Blood Orange Margarita ($9), which you should get with salt even though it's a little sweet. It was a strong drink, and the sweetness wasn't overpowering.

For my meal, I started with the housemade guacamole to go with our tasty chips and spicy salsa, then had cheese enchiladas and finished with a Tres Leche cake. The guacamole was so amazing, other people at the table were also inspired to order it for their starter. I really liked the cheese enchiladas, but, as my mom pointed out, they're more modern in that they're not smothered and dripping with cheese. Instead, they're covered in an interesting creamy ancho sauce. I guess I prefer traditional cheese enchiladas, but there was still a ton of cheese inside the tortillas that made me happy.

The cake was really interesting. Someone compared it to a bread pudding, since it was really crumbly and wet because it was drenched in a milky sauce. I liked it, but it was too rich to finish.

Altogether, I thought the meal was an excellent deal. I would definitely go back for the lively ambiance and tasty take on Mexican food.",1
"Killer sandwiches and dill potato salad that set my world on end.

I wish I had known of Bertha's while I was in town for a long period of time because I would have eaten here everyday.  

I went for the blue cheese roast beef sandwich which was a magical meal.  Lightly toasted bread, slightly sweet mustard mayo, fresh veggies and the most beautiful sliced roast beef I have seen in a long time, this sandwich was nothing short of awesome, damn it was good.  

As a side I got the dill potato salad, this stuff is NOT your grandmothers potato salad, this is what your grandmother should have been giving you.  Holy wow, creamy dill potato greatness.  I am going to have to figure out how to get this out to me in LA.

The deserts looked great and the little chocolate brownie cookie gave me an idea of how good the other offerings most likely are.

Bertha's is awesome, fresh sando's, salads, wraps and potato salad that will redefine the potato.  Bertha's please open a location in LA, I will keep you afloat!",1
"Great little sushi spot with a heck of an all-u-can eat deal.  I like it.  The staff is great, the food is great quality and the prices are fair.  My only complaint: Nearly every time I leave Sushi Q I get hit up by the pan handlers working the liquor store next door.  4 stars for price, quality, and staff.",1
"I went to NOCA about a month after is opened and was wowed. I told all my fellow foodies about my wonderful experience, the innovative menu and all the little extras that made the meal a really special dining experience in Phoenix. 
I went back with friends twice after in the coming months and was pleased each time. 
I just went back this past Saturday though, and would have to say I would no longer suggest it for a special night out. It was as if the magic was gone and that the place was showing its age and loosing its ""specialness"". It was really just ok. The chef's talent shows, but too many other let downs. 
When we arrived for our 8:30 reservation the place was crowded. The host was friendly and told us that our table would be ready soon and it was. We sat down at our table and that's when things started turning out not as well as expected. Seated in a back corner--which I did not mind---I noticed the walls were filthy---scratched and beat up and dirty. That was my view, so of course its all I could focus on. The waiter did not show up for 5 min. to take our drink order, and when he did it took 20 min. to get them to us. He apologized, but at 8:45 on a Saturday night that waiting for a first drink is not fun. 
When then settled down with our menus and picked our choices. It was then we were told that they were out of the veal --which of course 2 of us had chosen by then, and that there was only one Skate dish--which of course the other 2 of us had decided on. They were also out of 3 other items. I felt I was back in the old Eleve (located in this same spot)--the food was great there as well---when they did not run out of many items on the menu. They may be ok when you have a larger menu, but with a small menu to begin with this is a real disappointment. 
Gone were the pop rocks that I thought was so fun as an intermezzo, instead a spoon of something that was not described was set down in front of us. A simple salad--good--was $15---and most starters are at least that much. Good, but not worth the price. Otherwise, entrees were good--not special, but tasty and served with good presentation. The cotton candy is still there--and still an attention getter. And I still love the desert selections---especially the malt that I had with mini doughnuts in with dipping sauces. 
I think I am able to overlook the fact that its really not an attractive room--the energy from the kitchen and the close tables add noise and excitement to the room, but the art and lighting is ugly and now that its starting to look run down as well--there are too many new, beautiful places in the city with equally good food and equally as pricey that are not in strip mall. And they usually still have most menu selections on a Saturday night.",2
"This is hands down the best burrito in the East Valley! Fav's is always consistent and their prices are excellent! My standard meal is a California Carne Asada burrito, it comes with the most tender carne asada I've ever had. Also, their green and red sauce is a step above the competition, and they have great mexican rice, it comes with peas and carrots! Guac is exceptional, and they also have really tasty breakfast burritos that are available all day. Five stars for being consistent, clean and for having pleasant and professional employees! One more thing is that they close at midnight except for Sunday when they close at 10. Bummer but still the best!",1
"Im a sucker for great libations and the stores that can carry the works.. Zinfandel for me.. Magners for my boy.. ( a great Irish cider we fell in love with in SF)..
great tequilas.. all types of wines.. you get my sniffster...",1
"Stop by today for California Burger and I also their chocolate brownie delight sundae.  It is probably one of the best sundaes I have ever had.  If you are a chocolate fan, this place is definitely something that you will want to try. The help is friendly and helpful.",1
"Such strange combinations of flavors, yet they taste so good.  We've been here three or four times and are never disappointed.",1
"I like this store. It is not perfect, it is not a real farmer's market, but they have many things which other stores do not carry. 

First of all, their fresh sausages made from scratch daily are to die for. Even if you don't like the store overall, just go there, buy a few different sausages and grill them with 100% natural wood charcoal. (Please, do not use lighter fluid! Take a piece of bounty, soak it in some cheap olive oil and you will ignite anything)
If you see 15 different kinds of sausage and don't know which one you may like, ask for their sausage menu; there is a description and list of all ingredients.

Then lets go to their meat department. Grass fed meet. It is not something you will see at any regular store. Is it good? It is worth extra? I'm a skeptic, but I found it to be way better than a regular meat.  Grass fed ground beef was so good! We made burgers and I could definitely taste the difference. 
Grass fed filet mignon was also very nice. It was not better than USDA prime filet mignon from Costco, but it was way better than regular corn fed  filet mignon. I wish farmers would go back to the old times, when they were not controlled by 5 corporations and nobody was forcing cows to eat corn, but I digress...

Need real organic eggs and willing to pay $5 per dozen? No problem, they are here. Frankly, I could not tell that these organic eggs were way better than regular eggs for half the price, but maybe people who bake can tell the difference...

Also, if you're looking for that particular brand of sour cream, butter, kefir  (lowfat yogurt), most likely, you will find it there - they carry many different brands and it seems they do not favor one over another. 

Try organic bananas and tell me they taste the same as regular ones. They do not, they are way better, they have flavor and they are sweet. They almost taste like bananas you would get on Caribbean islands. The one they sell to you the same day they take it off the tree... when it was already yellow and ripe Try peaches and apricots from Chile. They taste like peaches and apricots. Yes, some will have marks, dents and will not look perfect, you have to select, but I rather spend 3 extra minutes picking good ones than get tasteless, but all perfectly looking fruits.

Now, bad. Of course, they do not always have best fruits and vegetables and a lot of them have a tag ""Mexico"". It is unfortunate that ""grown in Mexico"" is associated with poor produce nowadays. Mexico has a great climate and they can definitely grow tasty, pesticide free fruits and vegetables. Unfortunately, the market drives demand in a capitalist economy. Many people still look for huge and cheap. Companies provide huge and cheap. Some people are poor, they don't have money to buy quality produce and overpay for organic.  It is sad, but unless we stop buying crappy produce, organic will be super expensive for a while (no competition).

These huge see through plastic bins filled with different nuts seems like a great idea at first, but way too unsanitary. People open these bins with their dirty hands, dip into them, cough and sneeze next to them and that's where you get your nuts from? No way! At least, not for me.

Fish section looks sad, which seems to be a trend in every AZ supermarket. You can find better fish in our area at Costo (huge amounts, good for big families), sometimes AJs (not always though), Mekong plaza supermarket or Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket. That's it.  if you know any other places where I can get fish which does not smell fishy, please let me know.

A lot of their organic produce, including potato is wrapped with a sticky label which says organic on every item. Ughh... it was so annoying to remove wrap around labels from every potato that at the end I didn't not care for the taste - I just wanted to finish peeling them. I guess, the store has to identify organic food somehow, but these extremely sticky labels are not a good idea. Think of something else, Sprout.

So, this Sprout store is not perfect, but I will continue visiting it every week and look forward to some  improvements in the future.",1
"I had the misfortune of stopping by this establishment today with two things, a skirt and a cloth handbag. I asked the woman at the counter if I could have some very minor stitching done on a cloth purse. She looked it over for about 3 seconds and said 'Oh no I don't see how this could be repaired'. (what I wanted sewn were two little pom poms attached to the cloth strap that were loose and I wanted them to be stitched on there tighter). Not a difficult task. She then told me that she could maybe 'send it out' and have it stitched but it would take a week or more to get it back. WHAT??!
I then asked her about  the skirt which I wanted cleaned and/or pressed with the tags attached (because I'm selling it). She said no that the tags would be destroyed in the process. 
So I went to another dry cleaners and asked the same things for both the skirt and the bag. I was informed that what I wanted done would be no problem and that I could pick it up the next day.",2
I love their beef sandwiches and thin crust pizza. It is just like being back in Chicago. Love it!,1
"I've been to several local dermatologist and havent seen results or been fond of any; the staff is extremly friendly and very helpful! I highly reccomend this dr, he is knowledgeable & helped me attain the results I was looking for!",1
"I was so looking forward to going to this restaurant.  It has a nice view of a man-made pond, but the food is barely average.  If the ambience wasn't so nice, it would get only 2 stars.",0
"DV Nail, may I help you? YES! You can - and always well. I've been going to DV Nails for years and they're great. I've ""cheated"" on them a few times when I hear of similar nail shops in the area offering specials and mini hot stone massages with a manicure but I always end up back at DV Nail. 

Their massage chairs are wonderful - strong massagers. You actually feel like you're getting worked on. They're clean, friendly and always do a great job for the price. It's not fancy by any means and I wish they'd turn on the radio instead of the fuzzy TV but they're consistently good. They carry every Essie & OPI color and my manicures always last a long time. A manicure & pedicure is $28 total + tip. I think that's great. 

I typically request Tina or Julie - they both take their time and do great. Don't be fooled by this place... there's often a long wait. I'd recommend an appointment.",1
"Have the owners from here ever even had a bagel from back east? Certainly doesn't taste like it, and they charge double what they do back east too. No thanks. The search for a good bagel continues, for now I'll just keep having them shipped straight from NJ.",2
"So I was introduced to this station about 6 months ago by a fellow yelper who goes by Amy D... She has a wicked 8-10 spot on Tuesdays and I thoroughly enjoy listening to it on a weekly basis. Well, I was happened upon an opportunity... Nay! A priviledge of being a guest on this FABULOUS show and, being the attention whore that I have been labeled, I accepted.  I won't go into HOW I found myself being handed this prestigious title of KWSS Guest, but it involved a House of Clubs, Twitter, and a whole lot of begging (on my part)...

There I was... in the presence of 100% pure, raw (Can't decide which word to use ""Talent"" or ""Creativity"") and in a pretty bad ass studio. The Fabulous Amy and I discussed all the important topics of the nation/world and stumbled on numerous great ideas. One being a cure for cancer! Okay, we didn't discover a cure per say... but we did briefly talk about it.

The listeners were top notch and the atmosphere was professional, yet extremely comfortable. Plus, we actually got some free talent from a caller! He was awesome and sang me happy birthday.  It was sexy.

Thanks for a great time, Amy and KWSS! You rock, alternatively!",1
Great home made taste on the meatballs.  Also they have diet coke.  Shop was nice and clean.  Friendly and fast service,1
"If you can look past the giant Meth billboard right outside and the general uncleanliness of the entire establishment, it's pretty wonderful... especially if your intentions involve eating a whole lobster, like myself.

Gourmet House of Hong Kong has the cheapest whole lobster dishes I've ever found, anywhere. I don't mean a measly, mid-western, tourist trap restaurant kind of lobster, I mean a damn good, meaty, savory, juicy morsel of deliciousness.

It's served a number of ways, but I usually go for the black bean sauce style. Then, I eat like nobody's watching, vow to never let my boyfriend see me like this, and usually end up getting sauce on my face, clothing, table, neighbors, etc. Go messy, or go home.",1
i decided to give this place a second try i went to one of there stores right after they opened and was not impressed.finding good seafood in az is always a chalenge so i thought that f&e might be worth a try again but i was saddley mistaken on the shelf sat a few lonley packs of sea scallops and some  shrimp alot of hamburger and a few highly overpriced packs of lamb and a sh&^%t load of chicken. they seam to have alot of prepared food for people on the go or dont cook i think sprouts is a much better option,2
"So the food at this place is good. Well the sliced turkey sud. But when it came to delivery and internet ordering. Oh my god the incompetence of these people. After and hour, 15 mins after the food was suppose to be delivered (the order was 2 turkey subs and garlic cheese bread.) I called and was told that there was no delivery guy and if i can come pick it up that they would knock off 25%. But the foods not ready yet, how long does it take to make 2 subs. So i pick up the goods and damned if i didn't check the bag they didn't give me the 2nd sub. Ugh they never checked the order. If you have online ordering  you need to follow though. So with a second phone call and a second trip to the place and 2 hrs after the original order i FINALLY get home and eat. The only good thing i got was a free lunch.  For that I give them a 1",2
"Best cupcakes ever. I can't get enough of the Strawberry and Red Velvet. They even have a gluten free Red Velvet! Order several to take home. They will give you a zip-loc bag that keeps them fresh and moist for days! I'm addicted. Not cheap, about $22 for 6 but when you taste them, who cares....",1
"I'm used to Ranch 99 back in Northern California, and this supermarket wasn't anything spectacular. This is a good place if you want seafood! All of the traffic was around that area. The food from the take-out section didn't look too good.

The market also has the bakery, peking duck, the flattened 1/2 duck, and roasted chicken. 

There is also Hong Kong Express to-go food where you can order noodles, dim sum, congee, boba drinks, rice dishes, etc. It's right next to the take-out food. 

The most interesting part of the supermarket was the selling of Chinese pancakes in front of the store. You can order mini pancakes with either a red bean, coconut, or custard filling. Each pancake is made to order and is $.50 each. I tried both the custard and red bean pancakes and it was pretty good! Cash only payment for the pancakes. You also have to wait awhile for the pancakes since there is a long line.",0
"God Bless Lifetime Fitness.

First off, let me tell you how much I despise working out.  Like, at times I'd rather drink my own pee than even come within 50 feet of the stair stepper.  

However, LTF (have you noticed that I like to abbreviate?  Get used to it friends...)  makes my gym experience fairly painless.  Steve W, I salute you for aknowledging the value of such a fine work-out establishment, and I actually have many of the same opinions. But because I like to hear myself talk, I'll reiterate some of my favorite points.

First off, I'm absolutely not a fan of children.  Especially at a gym.  Lifetime has FREE childcare for kiddos 12 and under so us singles can flirt our way through our workout without your kids sniffling and screaming.  Kids can play and swim outside under parental supervision at the pool, complete with waterslides and some kid-specifc water fountain spray thing.  They love it.  And I do too.  WATERSLIDES?  I mean come on.  LoveitLoveit.

Lifetime's members span the board, which is nice because I like the fact that I'm not the most out of shape person there.  I also like that there is nice scenery to watch and inspire me to keep my feet on that god forsaken stair stepper.  You may even see a professional athelete or TV personality on occasion.  Who doesnt love that?

You never wait for a piece of equipement because there are tons of machines.  And they are not covered in meathead sweat, which is always nice.

My favorite part of LTF is the group classes.  Excellent teachers, classes every day of the week, and a good variety of options.  I'd like to see more coreographed classes like Hip-Hop, but whatever, Kickboxing Jam is pretty damn close.   

Locker rooms are always spotless, towel service is free, sauna and steam rooms arent full of weirdo naked people, and they have this device that dries your bathing suit in under a minute.  Ingenious!  

I've been a member of a ton of Scottsdale gyms but I drive the extra 20 minutes in rush hour to go to the Tempe LTF.  Doesnt road rage burn calories anyway??  Win-win situation.",1
"On a recent visit to Arizona, my mother and I ventured into this store. Neither of us had stepped foot in it before, even though she lives a mile away. 

The aisles are broken out by cuisine, and the selection was awesome.  I was particularly surprised by the Holland, Dutch, Brazilian, and British aisle, in market classified as Asian. Very unexpected. I bet they would be more business if they boasted to be more international. 

I really liked this place, but the word needs to get out about Lee Lee's.  If more people shop, they will restock their shelves more often, and most items won't be so close to their expiration date. 

Final points:
- check expiration dates before purchasing
- Generally clean but the shelved items needed to be dusted and straightened, especially the aisle with dishes. They were all over the place and had to hunt for matching bowls.  It's a market, not a dollar store
- If you can get past the initial fish smell, you won't be disappointed.",0
I visited Sala Thai with a friend and I had the Pad Thai.  Food was pretty tasty and very filling.  It had a nice tang but I might have preferred to have a fork and knife to cut the very long noodles with.  Other than that I'd definitely visit again.,1
"If you own a car that is older and you want it to look and smell new - this is the place.  Our 3 year old truck looks brand spanking new after these guys got done with it.  We also had them tint it and it turned out amazing ... again ... I say again because this is the second vehicle I have taken to them.  That is the main reason I went back - I could not believe how good both my vehicles turned out.  I had the window tint on the other one for about 3 years before I sold it and still to the day I sold it ... the tint was perfect.  They use only the top quality film, and do quality work.  I will keep going back and sing their praises all day long!  If you are looking for a detail job, or window tint, this is the ONLY place you should be looking!  Check out some pictures I took of my vehicles after they got done..",1
"Slices Pizza is pretty good, not the best though. But if you are on Mill Ave its the best Pizza option.  Uno's is around the corner and probably the worst pizza in Phoenix.  If the main guy that works there was not so rude probably would have given it 3 stars.  If you are in Tempe a much better Pizza place is Red Devil Pizza about 5 minutes South.",2
Another excellent find in Scottsdale.  The service is wonderful and the food is extremely flavorful with good size portions.  The sea scallops and herb chicken are highly recommended.,1
"I was actually really excited to eat at the Saguaro Grille the first (and last) time I went there. Finally, a reasonably priced casual restaurant not owned by a corporation.  Or mad persons

First of all, the waiter had no idea what the soup was or what kind of bread they had available since apparently their actual bread inventory bore no resemblance to the one printed on the menu. The waitress berated him for not knowing, and then went on to make it obvious she hadn't a clue herself. She tried to talk us into getting croissants. Neither of us were ordering things that belonged on croissants. My dining companion got a portabella burger that's a burger with a giant mushroom cap instead of meat for people sans veggie friends -and I got a chicken sandwich and Italian wedding soup. We had to repeat the order two or three times before the waiter got it.

The waiter subsequently returned my dining companion how she wanted her burger done. She gently pointed out that portabella burgers have only two possible states- done and note done. Such is the dichotomy of mushroom burger kind. ""Wait, you wanted a what?"" slurred the waiter. He had put in for a regular beef burger. Turned out, they didn't actually have a portabella in the place. 

We waited. The soup showed up in one of those skinny coffee mugs and the waiter tried to pawn it off on the wrong person. It was pretty good soup, but there was simply no way to adjust the seasonings without making a sloshy mess. 

My sandwich, well, it was OK. Nothing to write home about. I was very hungry and it didn't strike me until I was almost done the promised buttermilk ranch dressing was regular ranch with buttermilk.  My dining companion's fruit was on the old side, and her tuna melt not particularly tuna-tastic.

We are masochists. We decided to have some dessert. The one thing on the menu we wanted was, of course, not actually available, so we decided to just go with coffee. Mum ordered cold coffee. She specifically said, ""I'll have a small iced coffee."" I ordered a double shot of espresso. Not too complex. 

The waiter came back a moment to make sure I really wanted a double shot of espresso in my iced coffee.

Absolutely not worth the price or the obligatory trip to the twilight zone.",2
"Really mixed feelings here. Met a friend here on a Thursday about 6:45. Place was busy, but we were able to get seated immediately as it wasn't totally full, and even being not at capacity, it was insanely loud. Naturally I expect a beer bar to have a relatively high volume but this place was ridiculously loud to the point of being annoying.

The beer selection was good though I'm not sure that makes up for the loudness and atmosphere that seemed a bit off: really brightly lit, and the decorating was of the signs-bought-new-but-made-to-look-old variety. Almost like a Bennigan's, kind of fakey-like. And why oh why does a place that specializes in beer and seats so many people have just a single urinal and single stall in the tiny men's bathroom? I hate standing in line to pee but than again maybe I'm just getting old :D (as an aside, obviously I have no experience using the women's so can't address that, sorry ladies)

I'll try it again though. Food was OK, not great. Probably won't be a regular hangout since it's not close by to where I live and it didn't seem worth going out of the way for considering how many other beer bars/breweries there are around the city with better atmosphere.",0
this is not in the mall dq a real road side flash back,1
"Meh.

I went to Big Bang a lot during the peak of my ASU bar hopping days, but never fell in love with the place. It was (still is?) one of the only bars on Mill that charges cover. I don't recall any decent drink specials; domestic beers only. 

Of course, everyone's in love with the dueling pianos. Sure it's fun when you're inebriated, but gets old fast. I hear the exact same songs every time I go. I personally guarantee you'll hear 'What I Got' and  'Sweeeeeeet Caroline' at least once.

Overall, a solid veteran of the Mill Ave scene.",0
One of the reviewers said this owner wants to run a restaurant - I completely agree.  That has good sides and bad of course in short it isn't Palette  ... We stopped in for brunch last Sunday - the French Toast is Challah [which I love] restaurant-baked I think - and seemingly not fully baked - the center was dough.  The scrambled eggs were adequate - the restaurant-made salsa verde was excellent; the Schreiners sausage as expected.  That was all we had - quality not a compelling reason to return ... until the service is factored in - crisp timely and friendly.  I'll be back to try dinner.,0
"Same Majerle's menu as the other locations.  Decent food (especially wings), but high prices for both food and drink.  Good service -- even overattentive on my last visit.  Great setup for watching football games.",0
"I really like this place. I spent 2 years in Honolulu and used to eat at this great little place in China Town. I have been craving that food since I got off the plane to move back to Phoenix. Well, I found China Chili and I am SO glad I did! The Honey Walnut Prawns are so  yummy! The fried rice and lo-mein noodles are smoky tasting, and hot out of the wok. Is it healthy? Maybe not. Is it non-greasy? Um... not really. Is it delicious when you're craving some really filling Chinese food? Yes. I wish it were closer to my place so I could have it more often, but I'm sure I'm sparing my waistline of more issues!",1
"Barrio Cafe is a favorite of mine, the margarita's before you get seated are a must.  When in season the pomegranate guacamole is second to none.  A refreshing escape from the cookie cutter chain restaurants.  When you go go with friends and don't have a schedule as the wait can be long, but worth it.",1
Great food and very friendly service.  Happy to recommend!,1
"Rivas helped me get through numerous late night study sessions and early morning hangovers!  Hard to go wrong with anything on the menu, but my two faves are the Carne Asada and Chile Rellano burritos...with fresh horchata, of course!",1
"Super cool, cookie/cake.chocolate maker haven!  :)  Totally worth the 40 minute drive I had - it was packed when I got there and I did not experience one little bit of rudeness.  I arrived with my 5yo and after cruising the aisles for a bit an employee came by to see if I needed help finding anything.  Super neat place!  :)",1
"2.5 stars really. I've been holding off on the review because I stunned myself by paying $6.50 for a macaroon. Really? I did that! Ugh. It was tasty but $6.50!?! 

And, that's not even counting my breakfast: $9 for a wedge of quiche and a salad (that I didn't want - I just wanted a piece of quiche). 

I don't mind paying for good food (anyone who knows me knows food is pretty much WHAT I spend my money on... ) but I'm having huge buyer's remorse... over my meal! Something's not right with that.",2
Loved it! Best French toast ever!,1
"I love Victoria's Secret, but this store has a terrible selection, and the employees are rude here.  I have visited many locations all over the U.S., and was not happy with this one. They were very pushy about trying to get me to buy bras that I did not like as I only buy a certain style of bra from here.  I also thought that there selection of PINK merchandise was severely lacking.",2
We stopped here on our way back from Wildlife World Zoo after seeing they changed the restaurant there and it doesn't have very good reviews. This was a great alternative. Plenty of food and a nice variety. I enjoyed it.,1
"Upon first glance this is appears to be a very usual strip mall type bar but behind the black glass lies a more unusual bar and grill.

We went on a Sunday for the Jets-Ravens game and it was a fun time.. This is one of those places you likely have passed a hundred times on the way to work or going to Scottsdale using Indian School Rd. It is set back into the strip mall so you would not see it from the street. Why Teakwoods is special comes from its extremely quality food which you would not expect from a place that lets you throw peanut shells on the floor. Like most bars it has a bevy of TV's and a rowdy but pleasant crowd. 

The food was really good though I would never call this ""fine dining"". An extremely great place to go when you want to be stuffed with semi-greasy food..I had their famous wings and I can honestly say they were outrageous. I especially liked the cheese balls which are hard to find as WineBurger stopped carrying them.

No particular reason this place wasn't 5 stars..it just didnt have that 5 star feel..maybe in the future when I go back.",1
"It is with great regret that I give House of Tricks three stars.

I've been here twice.  The first time, friends invited me and the wifey here for dinner.  Seeing the patio, I thought, ""oh, this is really cute.""  Once seated inside, I thought, ""oh, this is really cute.""  Seeing the prices on the dinner menu, I thought, ""oh, this better be really good.""  Long story short, it was okay.  My friend, who had only been here for lunch, apologized for the unexpectedly high prices.  I didn't care too much, I guess.  It was edible.  I'd probably come back for lunch.

Which I did, with co-workers in tow.  The prices at noon were certainly more agreeable and we all looked forward to a pleasant meal.  Suddenly, this gem of an exchange occurred between our waiter and my boss, Debbi:

Debbi:  How large is the quiche?  I weigh 230 pounds, so I'm a big girl.

We giggled.  Debbi loves to joke.

Waiter:  Well, it's not as big as you.

Bad form, dude.  Bad form.  You're lucky we paid lunch menu prices.",0
Everything was average.  Fairly clean place.  Banh Xeo had to much bean sprouts.  The proportion of veg to meat was off.,0
"Decent menu which includes the traditional satay, tom yum koong, curries, pad thai etc. What threw me off was teriyaki, sweet and sour chicken, kung pao, chow mein. Food is good with great portions! Careful on the heat scale. 10 is blazin...
Weird thing....I was really thirsty after the meal. Usually that's the result of using the other type of SaLt. 
Overall the place is clean, modern, and staff are attentive. Curries are 10 bones, Fried rice at 9, and most entrees at 9 bones! Price is a buck plus more than our So Cal places. Give it a try, food is good, and service is fast.  
Damm..I need to drink another bottle of soda!!!

Excellent cheap Mexican food that tastes as good as any Mexican restaurant.,1
"I really like this bar & restaurant.  I usually come here to meet up with a friend and sit at the main bar.  It is modern and clean.  There are a couple bars to sit at and they even open a big door to a bar for the outside too.  They have some good brews on tap and have flat screen tv's as well.  

I have only had a burger and fries here.  They burger was really good, the fries were really greasy and were just okay.

The staff here is friendly & speedy.  I would recommend this place for a good place for someone looking for a nice place to grab a drink and converse.",1
"Lets satrt with the good, The brisket was a solid 7 on a 10 point scale.
I didnt like much else about a place even though I have been wanting to try for some time. It was cold and rainy today and I really wanted some comfort food just as I was passing BE BBQ. So I stopped in and sat at the bar. From the moment I walked in and sat down The poorly trained bartender struggled with every step. It was also very obvious that the well trained staff was frustrated with him to no end. The Bartender knocked a plate of food out of one servers hand a the entrence to the kitchen, he couldnt settle a check with special instruction twice, and his amaturish drink pouring skills shined bright on this cold and cloudy day.
OK Yelpers I admit Im a 20 years restaurant veteran and maybe thats why I was so stressed out watching the goings on but he things I was seeing was like a train wreck! but I just couldnt help but watch.
On to the food, I had extreemly high expectaions about the food and I even expected the prices to be on the Scottsdale side of high. What I wasnt expecting was the tiny BBQ Brisket sandwich, and I mean like 3 bites tiny.The BBQ Sauce was so heavy with chili powder and with almost no vinager  it was gritty. The fries served with the ""sadwich"" were also covered with tons of chili powder. The meat itself was tender and flavorfull and well smoked, but I was surprised that it was a cold, that was a turn off, but not as much as the small chintzy portion.
Well at least Big Earls is off my bucket list of must try restaurants, and as far as BBQ options in Scottsdale well that list is certainly shorter too.",2
"As Target's go this one is standard fare. That consistency is part of their brand recognition. However, as a part of the Up-Scale Desert Ridge Shopping Center, I'd expect a bit more than a Standard Target. Don't they have some sort of a Flagship Target?

Also traffic and parking can be atrocious at Desert Ridge. I drive to Target's and WalMart's much further from my house because the round trip time is less when I don't have to negotiate the teen packed Desert Ridge lot. Probably safer too.",0
"This isn't your typical Mexican restaurant that puts cheese and sour cream on everything. The food here is light, simple, and fresh. We started out with the guacamole which was amazing. My sister doesn't even like mandarin oranges but it tasted so good in the guacamole she was eating it like it was going out of style. The salsa that came with it was the bomb. One was a spicy red salsa and the other one was a tomatillo salsa. The green one was so good I wanted to drink it. I ordered the chorizo and eggs and my sister ordered a couple of tacos with rice and beans. Everything tasted great and I even had room for dessert after my meal. We had some kind of carmel, banana, crepe thing. It doesn't look like much but it was one of the best desserts I've ever had. Gallo Blanco is my new obsession.",1
"Located along the infamous, gutted for future LRT, Central Avenue is Community ( you know, like rainbow community) Florist. Serving the sistahs for years is a helpful, friendly and knowledgable staff. Prices are well below the chain florists here in Central Phoenix and I always like to help the small business owner, especially during this construction madness. I've purchased flowers here that last well over a week. They also have an eclectic collection of vases, things for the garden, cards, etc. So if you're trying to woo that special someone, or perhaps you messed up with the mister or you simply wanna say to yourself, ""I'm special. I like myself. I deserve tulips""....get on down to Community Florist. You know it's about time ya'll stop to smell the roses...",0
"This place loses out due to poor customer service, which is a shame, because the food is good.  it didn't used to always be this way.  It used to be good food with a friendly, attentive staff, but then they changed management. 

Our first experience with the new management and staff wasn't great.  Service was slow, but we figured they must be busy so we let it slide.  Then we bought stuff from the market.  They have two registers side-by-side--one for the market purchases and one for the restaurant bills. We went to the restaurant register so we could pay for our market purchases along with our meal.  First of all, we got ignored and had several customers taken before us, despite the fact that we were there first.  When they finally decided to acknowledge us, they told us we couldn't pay at that register since we had a market purchase.  Rather than just sliding over to the next register and taking care of the purchase there, they made us wait in line again.  Finally we checked out...and were overcharged.  We didn't realize this until we got home and by then it wasn't worth going back. 

We decided to give them another chance and went back a few weeks later.  This time the service was even more slow. 15 minutes passed before we even got our water.  45 minutes later our food still hadn't arrived.  The waitress kept speeding by our table and ignoring us.  We snarfed our food down fast when it finally got there since we had to get back, and went to pay.  Long wait again as we got ignored for other customers who came after us, and then they overcharged us.  Again.  Fortunately we caught it this time.  They hastily made the correction, without so much as an apology.  Rather, they acted annoyed that we were holding them up.  How about getting it right the first time if you don't want to do it again? 

So that was it.  I don't think we'll be going back.  It's really a shame, because the food is  delicious and this used to be one of our favorite places.  It's just a shame that the new staff sucks.  I can get good food elsewhere and not be treated like garbage and overcharged.",2
"Take someone that matters here and you won't be sorry. The service is some of the best in the world, and the food is stunning. The menu changes once or twice a year, and if you can't wrangle this place on an expense account, it is THE place to impress a client. Destined for a Michelin star....",1
"3 stars on any given day, my server PAT made this a fun experience and was the extra 2 stars.  Pat is one of the few people in this world who really enjoys being good at what he does.  I asked him, ""how long"" and with much joy he replied, ""I can get your food in 10-15 minutes"".  Sure enough it took 9 minutes.  I value time and in my business my word is everything.  Pat understands this and when I eat here again I will insist on his table.  I recommend you do the same.  ASK FOR PAT!!!

Top notch Pat.  Don't ever change.",1
"Contemporary atmosphere.  Good range of Italian offerings.  Attentive wait staff.  Portions generous.  Price reasonable.  Food fine.

"Always treat me well, very honest!!",1
I loved this place! Amazing food and service. The servings are just right and very flavorful. Would highly recommend this place if you want a nice quiet dinner.,1
"The Montelucia Resort is home to Crave Cafe, and the fact that I was blown away by how beautiful the resort is has nothing to do with how impressed I was with Crave.

What are you craving at the moment?  Perhaps a cup of coffee?  a scoop of gelato?  an empanada? gourmet pastry?  homemade tomato soup?  perhaps a panini sandwich filled with turkey, cheese,  grilled eggplant, and cranberry compote? red wine? magazine? fresh fruit? Diet Coke?

Whatever your 'crave-ing' - Crave has it all!

In addition to pretty much anything your heart desires, Crave also has an extremely friendly staff and offers limited seating (in and outside) with gorgeous views of Camelback mountain.

After a full tour of the resort, we were hungry for lunch and decided to have a quick bite at Crave... We shared a sandwich, slice of quiche, and tomato soup - all of it was delicious!  I am sure I'll be craving a return trip to the Montelucia sometime soon, and when I do, I'm sure I'll pop into Crave for whatever I need at that time.",1
"Since moving to Arizona I have selected Fry's as my new grocer and am very happy with my choice! I immediately signed up for their VIP card and love seeing the many savings listed on the receipt after every trip.

I am especially happy that I have moved closer to this Frys as it is open 24 hours and even when shopping in the wee hours of the morning can expect to see some nocturnal ASU students.

Any interactions I have had with the staff have been pleasant and enjoyable.",1
"Yes, as the other reviewers have stated, there are always extremely long lines and surly attendants at this location.  However, they have two automated machines where you can do almost everything you need to do without interacting with a human at all.  The machines are super easy to use and you can pay by credit card and it just prints out your label.  Not all post offices have these so it is a definite plus.

Also, if you have pre-paid envelopes or just regular stamped letters, there is a drive thru when you pull into the parking lot where you can go and just drop them in the boxes without even getting out of the car.  I know that you could take these items anywhere but I have found that they get where they are going at least a day faster by dropping them at this post office since it is the main sorting facility for our zip code.  Very important when you are a Netflix addict.",0
"Good food for a good price.  First time I've eaten at this location but it was as good as I hoped.  I got a half size Crunch Roll for an appetizer, and an order of Chicken Yakisoba.  Both were very good.  The crunch roll was very fresh with good quality ingredients, crunchy shrimp Tempura, crab, avocado, etc.  The yakisoba wasn't quite what I thought it would be in that the noodles and meat were separate, not mixed, but that didn't affect the quality or flavor.  It was closing time and I'd only eaten half, but I packed up the rest and brought it back to my motel so the workers could finish up and go home. 

This was the fourth place I'd attempted to go to for dinner so I was especially happy to find them open.  The first place, Azucar Peruvian, was right across the street from the motel I always stay at and I'd been meaning to try them since last summer.  I drove over there to find they were now out of business with a sign up advertising the place going in next.  I snoozed, I loozed.

 The second place was supposed to be open till 8:30pm according to their Yelp listing, but was closed when I got there a  few minutes after 8.

The third place, Omega Gyros, highly recommended on Yelp, was also out of business.  FML. 

So when I got to Yogi's I was holding my breath till I saw they were open till nine.  Thank you Yogi's!",1
"Ordered the pork ramen and a rainbow roll. Both were great, sushi was like every other good sushi place and pork ramen was tasty and spicey. Good service from waiter but the hostesses weren't able to keep up with everyone and forgot we were there and had us wait awhile. Other than that, experience was good and would come back.",1
"This place gets it right from the moment you walk in the door. Signed baseballs jerseys and bats by legends on the wall, a friendly host to greet you and when you sit down they ask if you want free chopped liver. It comes with bits of egg and onion, warm rye bread and bagel chips. 

Our waiter, Jeff, was friendly and attentive, even lending us his flashlight to read an old newspaper story in the rafters. The cream of mushroom soup made from scratch was superb. Our mains were baby back ribs, the specialty of the house, cooked perfectly with a flavorful sauce. The 'broasted' chicken was to die for: moist and juicy with a crispy outer skin. The fries were piping hot, as they should be. And the portions are beyond generous.

We topped it off with key lime pie, light and tasty, an ideal complement to the meaty mains. And the bill was under $60, an amazing deal. As a bonus, some of the players drop in during spring training.",1
"The place was pretty empty - even for an off night. The service was pretty decent, but like I said - it was empty. 

I've been in here a few times, but never when it's busy. The prices don't impress me, but I'd say you get a pretty decent pour for the money. 

One thing I'd like to point out - a 1.5L bottle of Dom is less than 1000 bucks, but a 3.0L bottle of Dom is 3500. If you're a fucking idiot, get the 3L. If you're a smart shopper, you'll get two 1.5L bottles or else just by the glass - which works out even cheaper. Just so you know, it works the opposite way Costco does. If you're getting a big ass bottle of Dom anyway, you probably don't care.

The decor is red. It's very dark in here at night... dark and loungy rather than clubby. Similar to Merc Bar, but not as hip or hidden... even though they try to hide it with curtains. It's also pleasantly quiet in here... easy to have conversations. 

With the patio door open, you're going to smell cigarettes people are smoking outside if you're sitting at the bar or on the couch adjacent to there. 

It's a nice bar, but I don't know that I'd single it out as a ""place to be."" I actually think the Mondrian is pretty nice - but that's based entirely on good memories that are completely unrelated to the place and have more to do with the people I was with at the time. If someone wealthy and hip was here from out of town looking to party, the Mondrian is one of a handful of hotels I'd suggest. Not so much because of Red Bar, but more because it's conveniently located within stumbling home distance to so many other better bars in Downtown.",0
"Phoenix Muni is a great stadium to see Oakland A's Spring Training Games. Yes, it's older than many of the other Arizona stadiums, but it has a simple charm that serves it wall. Great seats can be found just about anywhere in the park, and for $22 we were in row 7, just to the right of home plate. It's also pretty easy getting in and out of both the stadium and the parking lot.

The only (minor) negative is probably common to most stadiums: there don't seem to be enough vendors (at least beer vendors; several people around us mentioned it), and the concession stands can get somewhat backed up at times. But for a relaxing place to watch baseball in the Arizona sun, it's hard to beat Phoenix Municipal Stadium.",1
"I originally came here because I heard they have a gluten free menu--i expected one or two pizzas, probably cheese and one other choice. But they have a FULL menu of pizzas, salads, and appetizers that are gluten free. and they are DELICIOUS! 

Pizza was my absolute favorite food in my past, gluten-filled life. Anything from Slices to Pizzaria Bianco. I have tried gluten free pizzas almost everywhere you can find them, and they are always too dry, too thin, too soggy, or completely different flavor than what pizza crust should taste like.

 Picazzo's gluten free pizza is delicious, the crust is pretty thick and has a good texture, not like a big saltine cracker as most places tend to be. the flavor is true to pizza crust! my friends even like it so much they will split a gluten free pizza with me instead of ordering 'regular' crust.

There is also a range of appetizers that are delicious, caprese salad with gluten free bread and the spinach dip are my faves. 

The employees are all very nice and aware of gluten intolerance--they check with you before they bring you additional food items or before putting GF and non-GF foods together in your to go box. 

I love it. If you are gluten or wheat intolerant and  you like pizza, this will be your new favorite place. Totally worth the drive, and the money. But the prices are very reasonable for GF food!",1
"I enjoyed a pleasant lunch here with my carefree grandparents-in-law who recommended Tonto as a delicious place. When we first entered the I thought it might be full of retirees and rich Arizonians but I was pleasantly surprised to find a crowd of all sorts enjoying lunch on the outdoor patio overlooking a pretty view of the golf course and elegant Saguaros. Elegantly Casual American describes Tonto. 

Indeed it's pricey, but the food is fresh, creatively presented and delicious. (Extra pluses for using locally-sourced ingredients) 
I enjoyed the Mexican white shrimp tacos. The petite shrimp comes drenched in a sassy ancho chili green pepper sauce, complemented by a cool and zesty cabbage-carrot-cilanto slaw, avocado cream sauce and chewy homemade white corn tortillas. The fun is getting to assemble your own tacos. I ate nearly every bite and was stuffed for most of the day. 

My companions enjoyed the Reuben sandwich (layered corned beef on crispy rye, served with skinny fries that don't need ketchup) and the Halibut served on potato cake with spinach and carrot salad. Grandma-in-law said the halibut was tender and flavorful. I can imagine a bunch of friends or foodies mingling and laughing, sipping wine in relaxed delight as you drink in the beautiful view. 

Worth a visit, whether you're a local foodie or traveler.",1
"I've been to Bookman's a few times and have mixed feelings about it. If you're going just to look around, it's fun to see all the stuff they have in there. Between the movie selection, CD's, books and trinkets, it was fun to shop around. But, as someone interested in selling to them, I would never do that again. I brought in a huge selection of books I was interested in selling and they only took 4 of the books and offered me a few measely dollars. I was shocked. I understand they need to make a profit but I wasn't even getting $1 for each book they wanted. A total rip off if you ask me and a waste of time waiting for them to look through my stuff. I'm not sure if I will be returning anytime soon.",0
"The staff is friendly and knowledgable and the sales on stationary are always welcome.  Lots of specialty papers to purchase by the sheet or in packs of 25 or 50, with matching envelopes.  Oh so easy to give just the right touch to my correspondance.

Even when they are swamped with business the staff is always ready to lend a hand or help with a jammed machine.

When my puter is down I rent one of theirs for just $10 and hour with printing priveleges.",1
"They are helpful there and they are not helpful there, depends on how busy it is.  The place can be mobbed by rich teenagers and trendy asians, but if you have a warranty and need help, and you have an appointment then you are fine.  I have to admit having an macbook pro and an !phone, I am always drawn in.  

But the skinny crew with their cool black apple shirts can be quite helpful if you really need it.  It is hard to resist not going in.  The tech people really know their stuff.  I do wish another Apple store would open up in the West valley though.",1
"Before I shop at Whole Foods (which is on the same lot), I buy organic produce at TJ's because it tends to be much less expensive.  
Also a fan of the delicious frozen gluten-free pancakes, the organic vegetable pizza (which you can microwave in a pinch), the gluten-free ginger cookies, the should-be-illegal-they're-so-delicious lemon madeleine cookies, and the canned cat food, which has a minimum of junk.  Hubby also loves their frozen chocolate bananas.  I just wish that all of the TJ's stores stocked more organics.",1
"We get a date night rarely throughout the year, so I try and find something new when ever we get that chance. Once we made it into the restaurant we were both quite pleased with the decor and the atmosphere, little did we realize that this was just the beginning! The wait staff here is beyond friendly and knowledgeable, our server Sam was what you would consider first class in every aspect. His attention and knowledge started our evening off in such a way that I feel indebted to him!! Then comes the food....! We had a four course meal that not only included a wine pairing for two of the courses, but also a pre-dinner cocktail. The food was exquisite, the pork chop with the kale and pickled onion main course was grand, and the paired wine could not have been better.",1
"Not good. And it's not been for a couple of years. There are advantages: good location, rarely busy, good for larger groups. But last few times we've been there have experienced average food and lousy service.  When joining my already seated group on Saturday (3/28) the high-school hostess wagged her finger in my face like an East German border guard, the waffle house waitress poked me in the shoulder to get my attention and the wife's chicken dish had to be sent back as there were only 2 measly pieces of chicken in it.  Only 2 beers on tap. Garbage.",2
"The Farm at South Mountain is a splendid little slice of the country- right here in the middle of the desert!

The plentiful green grass spotted with picnic tables makes me want to plan a family reunion. There are gardens and walkways to explore. From first glance, The Farm is a quaint, family-run farmhouse.

Visit Morning Glory Cafe for breakfast and you won't be disappointed. I've personally enjoyed the Morning Glory Benedict on several occasions, while my brother is a big fan of the Farm Monte Cristo. Both dishes are made with as many local ingredients as possible... mmm... local-icious. 

The Farm Monte Cristo is about as close as any breakfast food gets to ""groin-grabbingly delicious."" (a la Homer Simpson) It's slow baked ham, over easy eggs, and melted cheese between two generous pieces of French Toast. Served with warm maple syrup, this is it, folks. The grand-daddy of breakfast foods. 

The service here is generally solid. Our servers tend to be interesting, friendly, and adorable- all good qualities to have when you're serving breakfast to someone who isn't happy about being up early.

I'll return... and return... and return. I'm hooked.

I only wish Morning Glory wasn't closed for the summer! Killing me.",1

"This place was the answer to my German grocery shopping dreams! I thank the Yelp community for leading me to Old Heidelberg. I was picking up a number of items for an Oktoberfest party I was cooking for and hosting at my house, and was able to fulfill most of my exotic German needs at this one stop. I picked up pumpernickel rye bread, authentic concentrated Maggi Würze seasoning (not the soy sauce-tasting stuff you find in most American grocery stores) and Knorr zwiebel-kräuter salat krönung. They also had lots of Knorr sauce mixes that you just can't find over here (for instance,  sauerbraten gravy).

I stuck around for a few minutes to talk to the two women who ran the place (Andrea and Chris). I volunteered that I had lived in Germany for years, including Berlin and Bavaria.  They were totally friendly and even suggested some other places nearby that I could check out for German grub or rarer German beer selections. I promised I would be back... especially since I spotted that they had frozen leberknödel (liver dumplings). I made these once from scratch years ago but that was a lot of work. Knowing that they carry such delicacies has snagged me hook, line and sinker, as I am now destined to return and once again indulge my German food fantasies.",1
"The husband and I went here for breakfast the other morning at about 9 am.  The patio was about 2/3 full but the inside was empty.  When you first walk in, you are greeted with menus that are extremely reminiscent of Pei Wei.  Turns out, you order the exact same way at said restaurant and you even get a number and choose your own table.  As I sat waiting for my food, I contemplated whether or not this concept worked well for breakfast.  The place started getting busy about 3 minutes after we sat down and I discovered the concept works quite well.

So many things on the menu looked delicious, and I had a hard time deciding what to get.  For starters, they have pancakes with peanut butter chips!  YUM!  Any restaurant that does peanut butter chip pancakes gets bonus points from me.  The rest of the menu varies from omelets to brizzas (breakfast pizzas) to good ol pigs in a blanket.  The husband and I decided to share a few things.  We got the peanut butter chip pancakes, the pigs in a blanket, and a cinnamon roll.  The pancakes were awesome and HUGE!  After just one I was already feeling full.  The pigs in a blanket were absolutely delicious, primarily because of the yummy and kind of spicy breakfast link.  The cinnamon roll was also tasty, nice and fresh, but not too cinnamony.  

Back to the concept of this place... once it had started to pick up again in terms of customers, I noticed how quickly the cashier was able to clear out the line.  I also noticed that the food was coming out at a really quick pace, and absolutely nothing sat on the line waiting to be served.  It works really well, but I am most interested in seeing how it works when the place gets absolutely slammed.

Overall, this is an excellent place to try.  You will not be disappointed with your fresh and delicious breakfast that doesn't make you feel heavy and gross after you leave.  A cool place for sure.",1
"i dont know why i didn't fall in love with pita jungle sooner. 

i work right next to the mall so the food court is super convenient for us. let me tell you a story of how i ate here everyday for lunch for a week. 

i ordered a standard gyro with no pickles (they put pickles on their gyros and i find that disgusting) 
my coworker, jen, ordered the pasta salad with chicken on top. 

mine was delicious and i tasted hers. hers was so good! i was like, that's what i'm ordering tomorrow.

the next day we went again and i ordered the chicken pasta. while waiting for the food to come out someone in front of me picked up their order of a hummus trio with chicken on top and a side of pita.

the next day jen asked where i wanted to go to lunch. i said pita jungle and i got my hummus trio. 

and the trend continued. their food is so good!!!! and its like $8!! and since i work nearby i get a discount! 

today i had a side of chicken breast with super fresh mushrooms. i watched them steam them, then put them in a pan with w tons of garlic, red wine, and seasoning. some of the best mushrooms i've ever had and it was a HUGE order of mushrooms.


i love this place!",1
"Lee's is the best privately owned ice cream parlor in Scottsdale! Located in Old Town Scottsdale in the heart of some prime dining locations, Lee's is a great night cap in the form of ice cream, a superb place to bring a date or all in all just a wonderful atmosphere to enjoy some ice cream con alcohol. 

Let's start with the aesthetics; Lee's offers a very clean, small, cozy environment.  A few table and chair sets dot the inside and a couple more to match on the outside. Lee has some awesome glass vases on the wall that add a modern touch. She has a few large clocks with different time zones so you know what time it is on the east coast while you eat? I dunno the clocks were kind of a head scratcher.

The Service is spectacular! Lee is the only help I've ever received there, so I am not sure if she works alone or has help. She is always timely and prompt to greet and serve you and automatically starts you off with TWO samples of which ever flavors you would like. All the young ones like myself be prepared to show ID, although you would have to eat a lot of ice cream to get loaded, Lee doesn't skimp on the booze either. Lee is usually a bit on the quiet side so you gotta listen up and be as patient with her as she is with you. The lady is running the joint by herself! 

The Product is what makes Lee's so good! Her ice cream flavors are inventive and wonderful. There is usually new options as well a few solid customer favorites too choose from. As pre-mentioned Lee does pack a fair amount of liquor in her ice cream so some of the flavors have a stronger alcohol flavor than others. The Jack Daniel's chocolate swirl is my personal favorite and has the perfect amount of bourbon to chocolate ratio to make a unique, delectable treat. Lee does offer non-alcoholic flavors (at a discounted price, too!) for those opt to take there alcohol and ice cream separate. The cookie dough flavor may be the best ice cream I have tried with or without booze.",1
"I haven't written a review in ages, but this place is SO GOOD that I'd be ashamed of myself if I didn't review it.

I am the most hyberbolic person in the whole world in the history of time, but this time, when I say that it was the best pancakes I've ever had, I'm not kidding.  Just insanely delicious.  Scrambled eggs were also some of the best I've had (and come on, they're scrambled eggs, so you don't expect that much variety), and the breakfast potatoes were very good.  I couldn't pinpoint the seasoning, but it's different than you usually get.

Coffee:  Yum.  I don't think I'd even heard of Arbuckle's, but apparently it's got a great reputation, and deservedly so.

The owner Joe stopped by our table, and was super nice and genuine.  Service was just fine too.

I'm sure Joe's will get a reputation and huge following soon, so believe the hype and check it out.",1
"holy crap.  try the side order of garlic mushrooms.  they are little pieces of heaven that are such a delight to pop in your mouth.

also, on the special menu right now there's a salad called the mediteranian chicken salad, which really truly may be the most incredible salad i've ever eaten in my life.  i wish i could drink the dressing that topped the impressive mix of greens, corn, roasted red peppers, cilantro, raisins, pine nuts, red onions, parsley, well-seasoned chicken, and i can't remember the rest.  omg.  beautiful.

service was fine, not exceptional, but the staff was friendly enough.
i'm so HAPPY i found this place.  go there.",1
"We came here for lunch and were a little leery when we first walked in. I had the cream of leek soup, my mother had the sausage salad, and my aunt had the Greek salad and we were all very impressed. We took a bangers and mash pasty to go, but we are so full, that it'll be awhile before we can try it. The service was a little slow, but the quality of food and atmosphere made up for the inconvenience.",1
"What a beautiful brunch oasis in downtown Phoenix.  Sitting outside on an April afternoon, listening to jazz and feeling the cool breeze (thanks to the misters), I felt like I was in the Mediterranean by the sea.  Or something like that.  Anyway, I really dug the atmosphere, and the food was delicious.  The Vegetarian Omelet was yummy, bursting with veggies, and the olives gave it a great flavor.  The potatoes were perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the whole wheat bread was thick and perfectly toasted.  I also had a few bites of the Banana Fosters French Toast, which is waaaaay too sweet, in my opinion, to be considered breakfast food but was a great finish to my meal.  The coffee is good enough to drink black.",1
"ordered the steak sandwich (medium rare).  Came out cooked medium.  Still very delicious.  French fries were not good, way too salty.  Server seemed as though he did not want to be there, with a grouchy attitude.",0

"I've been two Pie-Zanos twice now and I think my wife did the best job of describing the format of this unique dining experience:  Subway for Pizza.  Of course, this is not to imply that Pie-Zanos is staffed by mouth-breathing ""pizza artists"" or stocked with sub-par ingredients and generally filthy.  On the contrary, this ""Subway of Pizza"" is staffed by congenial and hip 20-30 somethings who are eager to please by heaping  tons of fresh and flavorful ingredients  onto your individual personalized pizza. 

Pie-Zanos allows you to pick from wheat or white dough and from up to 8 different sauces.  From there you can add herbs and crust flavoring and then you can pick from 6-8 different cheeses.  Then you select from the widest selection of pizza toppings you'll find anywhere.   The fare is basically affordable as long as you don't go apeshit on toppings (55 cents each after the first).   As a special bonus they have Pepsi products.   

I have also enjoyed the breadshits which are fresh and delightful and pair nicely with the traditional red marinara as well as the tomato-pesto. 

My only complaints with Pie-Zanos and what keeps it from achieving 5 stars is how busy it gets at lunch, limited indoor seating and the fact that they allow children's birthday parties which, when mixed with ubiquitous bad parenting, quickly turns a hip and snazzy pizza joint into a Chuck-E-Cheese's.",1
"Ok here goes.  I'll start with the bad and finish positive.  As far as Pizza goes, which is what we went for, I was not that impressed.  I must say I'm more of a NY style, by the slice pizza kind of guy.  So the pizza did not hit the spot.  Maybe a little too fancy for my palette. (You can take a boy out of the ghetto, but you can't take the ghetto out of the boy, so for me simple food is always better.)  Obviously, there are enough people who like gourmet pizza as this place has amazing reviews, so I'm just one simple man.

The obnoxious fat chick sitting right behind me proclaimed to her friend, ""I'm no longer investing time in men who aren't available!""  Put down the pizza and grab a dry salad and shut up!!  That's not really the restaurants fault though but I did have to endure that convo through the duration of my meal.

Our server was very nice however seemed very rushed and at times we had to wait for refills on water and for the check.  The atmosphere is very romantic outside with light trees and live music.  They even turned on one of the heaters on the patio for the lil lady.  We has the Crepe with Nutella chocolate powdered sugar and ice cream and it was very very good.  

Bottom line.  I'd be willing to come here again and try something other than pizza.",0
"I don't get it. Not the concept of a good vegetarian restaurant but the need to create mock this and mock that. The word mock appears on the menu no less than 30 times, and that made me want to flee pell mell at mach 1 out of there, sonic boom be damned. I understand it from a  marketing strategy to appeal to and or convert the carnivores and omnivores I suppose. Do meat eaters feel better about eating something vegetarian as long as it is shaped like a chicken wing? Has anyone gone to a steak joint and had mock carrots made from pork medallions?  I am also aware that we eat with our eyes, have preconceived notions of certain types of cuisine etc. However, I firmly believe that if an establishment uses veggies, legumes, tofu and such and gets creative instead of trying to reinvent the meat wheel, the end result would be much better. For Example the Mexicali burger, no mock meat reference here. How about listing something as ""whatever the hell it is"" served Parmesan style? 
 
I stopped here for lunch yesterday as I was in the area. Cool space, it was open colorful and inviting. A couple of organs line a small space up front. Nice mild funk flavor to the decor. Ordering is done counter style and they bring it out to you. You pretty much go behind the counter to get ice for your beverage which I thought was a bit of a weird queue. 

I ordered the spicy Thai peanut, a dish that offered mock choices, but I went with the crispy tofu. The brown rice that was the bedding here was ok, lukewarm at best. the dish lacked any real flavor and there was no spice whatsoever.The tofu tasted as if it was freezer burned, which really dumbfounded me. I think it may have been crisped long before it was served to me and microwaved, the texture was just off. Copious amounts of cock sauce, err... Sriracha saved it from blandsville.

I am not saying I would never return, as I tend to give places more than one chance. I love well prepared vegetarian dishes, just don't mock me.",2
"Side Door, West on Hayde, a small location that does it right. 
 If you respect the Chicago area you will recognize Vienna beef right away.  

I really enjoy the italian beef at this location, its hard to find a place that serves Italian Beef (see Defalcos Scottsdale Rd).  Bianca was our server and was very helpful for my first time, at the restaurant. If you live in the area check this place out for a quick bite to eat.  

Where are all the other reviews?",0
"I enjoy ""the BOP"" as my friend calls it on the same level that I enjoy pizza.  It's good, but it's not my desert island bar.  I go here to meet up with friends.  I've never been there on my own because let's face it.  I'm not likely to be caught dead trolling Scottsdale (even non-Scottsdale Scottsdale) by my lonesome.  The atmosphere is cozy and inviting.  Which kinda turns me off. I like my bars a bit seedier.  But if that's your thing then I'm cool with it.  I hear the food is pretty good for English fare, but hey who wants to waste time eating when you could be drinking?",0
"La Condesa is in a rather unassuming location in Phoenix.  But has a nice atmosphere when you get inside.  The first thing I noticed was their huge salsa bar.  We sat down and were brought menus and chips.  I tried most of their salsas.  They all had their own very unique flavor.  the peanut salsa was really interesting.  My favorite was their tomatillo salsa.  

I ordered the Oaxaca Mole taco and a carne asada taco.  The mole was excellent with great flavor.  The carne asada was bland and flavorless...huh?  I dumped salsa on the carne asada taco and when finished was rather disappointed in that particular offering.

Also ordered their calabacitas.  They were seasoned well and tasted great.  

I had a bite of my partner's pork taco and it was amazing.  

I am glad we found La Condesa and I will definitely visit again to try some more of their menu offerings.",0
"Service was slow and horrible. Got the steak and eggs.  Steak was half fat. Waiters response was ""Oh!  We have a new supplier"". He didnt take it back and charged us any way. Eggs were cold. Stay away from this place for eating. Bar looked happening.",2
"Okay, this place has received a ton of slack from prior reviews. I am not a huge fan of the food nor the 1950's style decor, but the people are nice and I have been more than satisfied with the spinach queso dip. I actually do get a craving for it which draws me every few months to that bright turquoise and black decor. 
The lunch menu is very reasonable and the lunch portion of the pollo magnifico was good! What this place lacks in food, is made up in quick, fairly friendly service, and an area that is convenient to downtown Scottsdale and the Giants Spring training stadium. I like the breezy patio area but the big black birds that stalk the fallen corn chips under your chair are a bit frightening. But after a game this March, I am actually looking forward to spinach dip and margarita at Julio G's.",2
"I went here while on vacation visiting my friend. Neither of us had been there before, but I know they have lots of locations on the west coast, so we gave it a try. 

The staff was totally rude. Before we went, we called to check the hours. The guy on the phone was patronizing and acted inconvenienced to have to give any information. 

The pizza was blah - totally generic and nothing special. If you're going to have mediocre food, you better have exceptional service. Double fail.",2
"I have been to Cherryblossom countless times for lunch over the past few years. I have to say the location kinda sucks, but that's because of all the traffic. Are they ever going to finish construction on Camelback?! 

Any way, I decided to get a to go lunch order today. Since it was actually chilly out, I ordered the cha-shu ramen noodles with a couple of their yummy bread rolls & also picked up a slice of their amazing blueberry bread. The rolls were yummy as usual & I ate half of the cha-shu, so good & a big enough portion for me to have it again for lunch tomorrow. 

Service can be slow there sometimes, it's best to go at 11am or after 1pm, to beat the lunch crowd. Other tasty items I have enjoyed here are: cali crunchy roll, double shrimp crunchy roll, grilled chicken salad (w/ginger dressing instead), calamari, edamame & I have tried a couple different pasta dishes which were surprisingly good!",1
"I went for both breakfast & dinner two days in a row. I got the commuter sandwich which was fabulous - didn't think such simple ingredients could blow my mind. I came back for dinner and got the kale & quiona salad - again - very simple, but amazing.

I need to come back and get the pizza!",1
"Treated with complete disrespect. Worst service I have ever experienced.  After waiting to see the manager I was directed to an employee who committed slander towards me very loudly in front of everyone in the store. Then the manager stepped in, spoke robotically without listening and then was incredibly harsh in tone and told me to leave. He said, ""leave, get out, now"" 
****************Don't go to this store/don't use verizon******************",2
"I have been twice, both at lunchtime. Cute (trendy) place, sushi rolls are decent, not spectacular. Loved sitting out on the patio; however, there was a distinct smell of sewage wafting by every once in a while. Not sure where that was coming from. 

The hostesses were unfriendly. Waitresses were nice enough, but wow, S L O W service.  I mean, my God. I had nearly polished of a bottle of sake by the time the food got there (which may account for my belief that the sushi was good, lol!). Same embarrassingly slow service in getting our check to leave.

Overpriced for a lunch menu, I thought, and the calamari appetizer was a huge disappointment. It was like ... TGI Fridays or something. Just very ... sportsbar-esque. Huge, rectangular chunks of calamari, heavily battered and deep fried. What happened to light tempura and calamari rings? Isn't this a Japanese restaurant?

All in all, it was okay. I was in good company both times, and had plenty of time to spend, so the slow service was not an issue, but it could be a problem if you have other plans. I will likely go back until I am able to find a comparable or better sushi place - I'm new to Arizona.",2
"NO.  Don't go. Don't do it.  This was my first visit and it was on a whim because we drive by it often.  

One other reviewer here made a wise statement - go the grocery store and buy frozen fish.  I promise it will be better than this.",2
"i love this place and their food!
what i mainly love is that their prices are extremely reasonable now so i can go more often.
their steaks are very good as are their ribs and chicken
as for appetizers, i love the signature Bloomin' onion and i recently tried their wings and i love them! it must be the seasonings and sauce
they taste very different.
and the service is alway excellent 
but when you do plan on going, make a reservation to avoid waiting too horribly long",1
"This really amounts to 3.5 stars.  I think after seeing all of the stellar reviews combined with my LOVE for Filipino food, my expectations were just too high.

I took a few coworkers with me to check out the food and see if I had finally found a local Filipino eatery to curb my cravings.  Not so much.  The pancit (my favorite Filipino entree) seemed to lack flavor and/or seasoning.  I also wanted more meat and veggies - maybe that's just due to what I'm used to.  It was more just oily noodles and missed that flavor I wanted.  The good news is the pancit is cooked to order so it's very fresh and hot - just be prepared to wait a few minutes.

I was also very excited to get some lumpia.  Again, not so much.  They were tiny with some mushed ingredients in them.  Also again, it may be just what I am used to, but I've always had ones which are longer with more fillings - stuff you can actually see and taste what's in them.

On a positive note, the folks there are extremely friendly and helpful.  It makes me want to like it even more.  I'll go back and give it another go - I'll give the chicken adobo (my other favorite) a shot for some redemption.

A few tips:
*If you order pancit, order first because everyone's items are not brought out at once and the rest of your party will be waiting on you.
*It is a small place - tough to fit the 5 of us.  There were only a few other tables to seat 2.

I really wanted to like you Karey's Kitchen...",0
"Went here for a work function today. What can I say, this place is awesome! A great variety of meats all cooked to perfection. My favorite was the bacon wrapped filet, yum!

Nice salad bar with good variety as well, instead of bacon bits, they have a bowl full of uncrumbled bacon.

Lastly a slice of cheesecake with strawberries, mmm.

Simply awesome stuff! Taking the wife when I can.",1

"OK guys (and gals too), I know size isn't everything, but OMG, this place has crazy size portions and I loooove it!  We ordered the calamari and the stuffed mushrooms (1/2 orders) and STILL, the servings were huge.  Six big stuffed mushrooms sitting on what seemed to me to be the biggest plate I have ever seen serving an appetizer.  They were great and tasty, but cooled down too quickly and who can do anything about that?  The calamari was decent, could have been spiced up a bit or served with something more than marinara sauce, but for those who don't like a lot of fan fare with their food, this would be perfect; classic calamari with classic sauce.  We loved the Stella Artois draft beer and martinis came out big and filled to the brim, just how I like them.  For our entrees we ordered the Baked Ziti and Sausage and the Rigatoni ""D"".  Both of them were absolutely fantastic...yumm.  And both were HUGE.  The baked ziti stayed warm right up until we packed the rest to take home because they actually bake it right in the ceramic type dish that they serve it in, very smart.  For those with little ones, the kids menu is awesome and probably the healthiest meal a kid is going to get anywhere.  Nothing at this place is pre packaged or pre made and that goes for the kids meals as well.  Their chicken fingers are home made (the pickiest of adults would eat these things!), no french fries; home made mashed potatoes and broccoli florets.  This is the KIDS menu!  Our waiter needed to be coaxed out of his shell, but he was still warm in that great way that the good ones know how to do without intruding.  Great leather booths, linen napkins, white table cloths with a white and red checkered one thrown on top for added warmth, elegant, but not stuffy.  Guys could go in with t-shirts and dress shorts and fit right in and for the ladies who like to dress up, you can as well with out feeling overly so.

I am definitely going here again, what a find!",1
"I had lunch here and had the sashimi tuna salad. It was fresh and tasty. I also ordered the miso soup which was actually quite good. Real chopped mushrooms and scallions and it wasn't too salty. It didn't taste like standard powdered miso that you would get at an average japanese restaurant. I also tried the cucumber lemonade which was quite good. Overall the service was attentive and our food came out promptly. My coworker had the seared tuna sliders and sweet potato hash which he looked pleased with. The portions were perfect for what we were in the mood for which was just something really light. It's a great place for lunch, the ambiance is nice especially if you're sitting on the patio. I'm not a huge fan of fusion style restaurants so it gets a 3 star rating out of me, but it's a nice place for a quick healthy meal if you're in the area.",0
"This place was a huge surprise and a huge relief!

Being a foodie, and quite the fan of healthy food, this place definitely lives up to those expectations.  If you've ever been to San Francisco, then you'll definitely get that feel when you enter the cafe.

It's got a great atmosphere, and the menu is by far the best when it comes to serving healthy ""organic"" foods.  I know that many places in the valley claim to serve healthy food, but serving ""all-natural"" and locally farmed foods doesn't necessarily mean it's healthy.  People that are true foodie's know exactly what I mean.

I ordered the Dragon Bowl with quinoa and it was delicious.  I'm excited to try this place again.",1
"We go to Fresh Wasabi a lot and usually it's the same thing...the service is not the fastest on the planet, but when you are there with good company you hardly notice. Their sushi is amazing and they have a perfectly priced menu. Love it!",1
"Alright, well seeing as I work right next door, my mouth has been watering over this place ever since I laid eyes upon the menu. And tonight, we finally had some yummy Rumbi take-out.

First things first: they're a little pricey, at first glance. However, their portions are *enormous*. Each of us ordered a full size bowl(Honey Orange Shrimp for me, Jamaican Jerk Kalua Pork for Jamie, Honey Orange Kalua Pork and Teriyaki Chicken for Jamie's parents). The full size bowls were more than enough to last the average person through dinner, and then through lunch the next day; packed full of rice/noodles, meat, and veggies, with each bowl containing a ramekin of sweet teriyaki sauce.

The shrimp in my bowl was perfectly tender and succulent, the Honey Orange sauce sweet, but not cloyingly so. The bowl came with a lime wedge, which added the perfect zing to the mellow coconut ""Rumbi rice"".

We also ordered some of their Bahama Mama's Tortilla Soup, which was a creamy coconut-based broth filled with chunks of grilled chicken, tortilla strips, and melty mozzarella. It was a good, cozy soup, but could have benefited from more depth--some tang, some spice, something.

For dessert, we had some of Rumbi's Key lime pie--moist, rich, and delectably sweet with a lovely measure of sour. Only complaint? The graham cracker crust was too mushy, soft, and crumbly; it would have been much better with a crispy bed under the pillowy-ness of the Key lime filling.

All in all? Great place with reasonable prices, given their generous portions. They have a TON of salad options, as well, each more inventive than the last, and I'll be returning to try and test each one :)",1
"decent.  the potstickers were kind of good.  I didn't really know what to expect.  it met my expectation.  the lychee pork was good and deserved the second helping.  the selection was impressive.  and the stuffed mushrooms had an interesting stuffing.  spam, was it?  some sort of sausage or other processed meat that made it quite a delightful surprise.",0
"Sugar bowl ice cream is yummy but what ice cream isn't? let's just say if one day I was craving ice cream, I wouldn't think of coming here specifically for theiiir tubs. Very average stuff.. similar to Breyers/ Dryers. 

What I diiid like was the price, their abundant seating area and location (=",0
"After a day full of meetings, I gathered the hubster and we headed out to eat some Mexican. I had visions of chips/salsa, and margaritas. We headed to On the Border on Stapley near Baseline but found that this location had closed. Egads. Then we remembered The Salty Senorita across the street. And thus begins the saga. ""Hi, are you here for happy hour?"". We said no but were seated in the bar area anyway. At least we got a booth. Lucky us, huh? Joe ""lots of product in his hair"" brought us menus and took our drink orders. He was pushing a certain type of Tequila and I took the bait, with the stipulation ""on the rocks with salt"". My drink, and hubster's water arrived and we ordered. The chips and salsa AND our dinners arrived at the same time. .Really Joe product??? Chips with the meal? FYI, chips and salsa here aren't complimentary, you have to order and pay for them. It was then we noticed ants had taken over our table. At first we thought it was just a couple but noooooooo. The hubster brought the ants to the attention of Joe product and he feigned concern but did not offer to sit us at another table. Now the hubster's getting annoyed. It's hard to enjoy yourself when you are swashing ants off the table. Our booth was by a window but we didn't see any influx from the window of ants, so we're not sure where they are coming from, but they don't stop. Hubster mentions it a second time, and then, again with feigned concern he offers to move us to a different table. By this time we are almost done eating and I just say let's finish and get the hell out of dodge. Our bill comes, we pay, and hubster asks for the manager. Hell, he's even younger than Joe Product and looks like he just woke up, thus we'll call him Bed Head. Bed Head offers to buy us a drink on the house? Really? That's your solution? He said he'd make sure other patrons aren't seated in this area. Egads, no thanks, we just wanted to leave. We weren't after free food, but the offer of 10% off or some kind of compensation for sharing our entire meal with ants would have been appreciated. A free drink? Hey,maybe one of those $60.00 margaritas would have made everything alright! As far as the food goes-I had the chicken antchiladas (get it, lol) with beans and rice and they were dry. I like my enchiladas with oodles of sauce and cheese, and these had very little sauce with a little design of sour cream on them. Hubster had a steak and avocado salad. He said it was ok. 
This is a never return place for us. 
And a note to Joe Product-chips and salsa should have arrived WITH the drinks, and before the meal.Reflecting back, we were there on Earth day so perhaps having ants share our meal was relevant.
The margarita gets a 7 out of 10 limes as it was pretty good.",2
"I always have fun here.

I went here on new years this year and had a good time.

I did see the most pathetic lesbian here. She wore her make up and dressed just ike the Shane Character in the LWord.

Al I could think was, WOW what a loser.
and I wish I was that skinny

Do you have no personality that you wear a costume everyday.!!

So I was with my girlfriend in line and we were holding each other. She walked away for five seconds and asked my girlfriend for her number.
My girlfriend totally dissed her.
I walked up and you could see the fear in her eye. She just kept saying  Sorry, Sorry, Sorry.

Well anyway aside from that I like this place.

But dont go in the bathroom unless you have to. There are always tranny's doing coke or k in the womens bathroom.

Make sure and use a tissue to lock and unlock the stall",1

"I first joined 24 hr fitness about a year ago, and I have had nothing but good experiences with the staff since the first day that I came in.  The people behind the front desk have always been very kind and attentive to my needs.  If I ever have a question or concern, it is always promptly answered or dealt with.  Some of them have even taken the time to learn my name and greet me as soon as I walk in the door! It is very impressive and makes for a very pleasant experience. :)


On another note, I have been training with Trace for about 6 months now.  My goal was to lose a little bit of weight and tone up my body, and I could not be happier with the results! In 6 months I have lost 12 lbs. and I look and feel amazing! He is incredibly knowledgeable about training and nutrition, giving his clients hard workouts as well as meal plans.  Trace is the total package!

**TIP: Try Trace's boot camp on Wednesday evenings at 7:30.  They will kick your butt!!",1
"Having just moved to Scottsdale, I had seen Four Peaks brews at local restaurants and couldn't wait to try it. My bf and I visited the brewery after a long day at the Phoenix Zoo. The location was easy to find with plenty of street parking (although it could be difficult during peak hours). We found a nice table on the half-indoor seating area. The ambiance was very cool, with a converted loft warehouse sort of feel.

The bf had the beer sampler, which I helped myself to some sips of. I ordered a pint of the Kilt Lifter, which was a great deal during happy hour. Next, I tried the Pumpkin Porter (full price, even during happy hour). Foodwise, I had the pub fish and chips, which are battered in Kilt Lifter, and the bf had the french dip. Both items were on par with good quality pub fare.

Kilt Lifter: great medium brew, very smooth. The type of beer you could drink every day and never tire of. Pumpkin Porter: we loved it so much, we purchased a growler so we could take some home! Note: there is an extra charge for filling up a growler with a seasonal brew. $4 for the growler itself, $10 for beer, and $5 seasonal charge. Normal refills of growlers are $10.

I am a beer lover. I have spent time living in Munich and drinking some of the best beers in the world. You can't go wrong with Four Peaks brews. Next stop, North Scottsdale location. Closer to home and hopefully just as great!",1
"5/7/12...
I have to make a correction to my review as I received communication from someone with the club.. 

I was informed that they are not like other clubs as they have a ""Two Item"" minimum, not a two drink minimum.   So you can order a food dish and a drink to meet that minimum.  And I did confirm that one in our group ordered a bottled water which counted toward his minimum.

So I stand corrected.",1
"Standard Burger King fare served at a snail's pace.  One cook, one sandwich maker, one cashier, plus 30 people in the queue.

"I am only reviewing this location as the other locations are hit and miss. The one on Tatum and Dynamite was bad both times we went there. So, I go out of my way for this Barro's Pizza. The decor is similar to all locations. Very drab and not very comfortable. But, we are talking about a pizza joint, so they will get a pass on the decor. 

I had a mini Hawaiian pizza on my last trip and was delicious! The crust was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The sauce was tasty and the perfect amount. I ate every bit of it with no crust leftovers. That was how outstanding it was. 

I am surprised that the consistency between locations is such a wild swing from outstanding to mediocre at best. The owner should look into that.",1
Best Subway anywhere. Super-friendly staff and always really clean!,1
"Went here for dinner tonight.  Service was great.  They still bring out the plate of pickles, but now they also brought slices of challah bread and rolls (the onion one is awesome).

I had the Vegetarian Delight Sandwich.  Very tasty.  The vegetable cream cheese on the sandwich was excellent.  Huge portions.  The tomato soup was good as well, but not as good as the soup at Bravi.

I tasted some of the onion strings.  Delicious.  They had a dipping sauce that was a bit spicy.  It was good too.

My husband got Aaron's Choice - some kind of pastrami/corned beef sandwich.  He liked it, but prefers Miracle Mile.  

Overall a good dining experience, and I got some bagels to go!",1

"Last time I went it was lunchtime on a weekday.  Our server was very quick and attentive.  The sushi lunch deal was *amazing.*  Piping hot miso, delicate seaweed salad, crisp cucumber salad, flavorful sauteed veggies, fresh orange slices and the main attraction - tuna, yellowtail and salmon all absolutely fresh and perfectly prepared.  I left totally stuffed and happy.  One caveat - they should turn down the music a little during lunch; happy hour should be one level of noise and lunch should be several octaves below that.",1

"Wow, what a busy place. We came here while visiting Scottsdale. We are always up for a good breakfast and it seemed that this was the appropriate restaurant to try. 

This place reminded us a bit of a great small pancake house in Anaheim, CA called the Original Pancake House. It is much bigger and modern, so it lacks charm, but the food is better than standard faire. With that said, the creativity is good in their menu selection, but poorly executed. I had the banana french toast and was a bit disappointed. The banana bread used was fine, but too dense for french toast. It hardly had any egg coating to truly classify it as french toast. 

They serve huge slices of raisin toast, but bigger is not necessarily better. Very dry and not flavorful. 

Eggs were fine, and the service was good. I would come here before going to IHOP, but I would seek a different small hole in the wall breakfast joint before rushing back here. Avoid the Sunday brunch hour patrons, unless you're prepared to wait an hour or so. Enjoy.",0
"I usually do not complain about bad food but the fish and chips gave my wife a serious case of food poisoning.  So if some manager reads this please check out your fish supply or change the cooking oil.  She never gets sick and has been sick all day (December 29, 2012) from the meal eaten December 28, 2012.",2
"I can summarize this in one word.  YUCK!  We went for dinner/supper, which is part of the problem.  We ordered t-bone steak and chicken.  The salad bowl had a hole right through the plastic and the steak was way thin.  We ordered it medium and any steak that thin just ends up being cooked as ""well done"" anyway.  Everything comes with grease dripping hash browns whether you want them or not.  At least the staff was friendly enough and food (if you call it that) was served quickly.  My personal recommendation is that if you're not going to eat breakfast, go somewhere else.",2
I absolutely LOVE the food from The Pitic! The place does look rundown and it is a rough neighborhood.. however those are the best places to eat aren't they? Food is made fresh to order and out of the 10 or so years I have been coming here the quality of food never changes. It is great for families and actually anyone looking for a great mexican meal. Their crunchy beef tacos are to die for :),1
"I stumbled upon this Friday's while walking around Phoenix on a Sunday afternoon.  I wanted to just go up and have a drink and then take some pictures of the empty baseball field.  Phoenix was completely empty!

When I got closer to Chase Field there were some more people and I realized that there was a game going on!  I didn't think I would be able to get into Friday's because of the game; however, it wasn't very busy!  I sat at the bar since I was by myself.  But once I was there awhile, I noticed there were still tables open looking out into the ballpark.  So basically you get to watch the game for free as long as you are ordering stuff.  I thought that was pretty cool.

As for the food/drink...
I ordered a daiquiri when I sat down.  It was pretty bad.  Almost too slushy.  I looked through the menu and asked if they had any smaller portions or lunch portion.  I was told that since it was a game day they have a different menu and everything is larger.  So I didn't order any food.

The service was good.  The waiter was nice and another waitress named Kimmy even came up and talked to me for a little while.  I'd definitely come here again just for the view.",0
"If we hadn't arrived after a tiring day and prepaid online, I would have checked out.  Furniture missing.  Security bar sheared off.  Faceplates for wiring gone.  Furniture handles missing.  Bobby pins and scraps of things on carpet - hadn't been vacuumed.  Two remaining chairs badly stained.  You wouldn't want to sit on them.  No uniforms or name tags on staff.  Pick another chain.  The reviews for the other Ramada's in the area - which I read after the fact - reflect the same things.",2
"So let me start by saying the latte was very good, best I've had in this area at least. Much better than Starbucks, even though that's not a very high standard but one that everyone can relate to. 

Good atmosphere, comfortable seat and lots of it... The live music was deceiving as it looked good for the out side (don't we all) and sounded horrible (but I'm not reviewing that am I) :) 

I was actually helped by a guy there who matched the place well. Good service with a grin and not the overly caffeinated pep talk baristas of a certain chain often feel pressured to give.

I'll be back if only for the latte.",0
"I met up with a few ladies here for drinks a few weeks back at the suggestion of someone else. We didn't end up playing pool, just enjoyed our drinks at the bar before moving over to a table. We were definitely over dressed and probably out of place, but it was a chill place to let loose. Drinks were okay, food was nothing outstanding, prices were to be expected.",0
"The Valley of the Sun has it's prevalance of *Bertos taco joints--Filebertos, Humbertos, Rolibertos, etc. Way out in FH, the open late (til 3 am on weekends) and thought it's slipped over the years, there is no better deal in FH. Generally good to go with the Shrimp Burrito (even better enchilada style if you can handle that). Most of the rest of the menu is good, thought I was disappointed to find ham rather than chorizo  on a breakfast burrito.",1

      We had tried to go the night before but they were packd so we made a reservation for the next night.It was really busy when we go there but we were seated immediately.Our server was really nice and very helpful when we told him we had never been there before.
           We ordered the fried alligator app,and loved every bite of it.I had the filet mignon and rock lobster tail.The steak was cooked perfectly and was a good size for the price.I'm not usually a huge fan of lobster but wanted to give it a try,Pappadeux has changed my opinion about lobster,the meat  came right out of the tail.It was buttery andjust plain yummy! It was the first chance hubby and I really had a chance to go out to eat without the kids,so we really wanted to make the most of our time.And we wre definetly able to do that here.Refills kept coming even after we had paid the bill.I also loved the live music from the jazz quartet making its way around the room.The only thing thats keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that the tables were too close to each other,and it was so loud I could hear the discussion at the table next to me but I had a hard time hearing my huband across the table.I will definetly be going back to Pappadeux over and over again.",1
"Decades ago when this festival was up and coming, and I lived in Tempe, I would go to this street fair as we called it then two or three times while it was going on. Today I went with a friend. The festival has grown by blocks now. It's pretty big, I think they claim 400 vendors! That has to include the food vendors. 
I had my fry bread taco. It was super good and $9 bucks. I looked for something to buy but left with nothing. The things I liked most were huge home items and big ticket prices. I saw a few handbags of interest but not within my budget either. It use to be that this festival would have jewelry, matted photography and pottery a college student could afford. That's still my budget this year, unfortunately - but such priced things could not be located here this year. So I'm disappointed with the festival offerings. 

Parking covered & uncovered was $10 if you could not find free street parking. There wasn't enough ice cream vendors in my opinion but there was plenty of food vendors and the neighboring eateries were also busy and offering variety. 

The entertainment was very limited. I hope they will seek more entertainment in the future especially since they claim its one of the top 20 street festivals in the country.  Otherwise there isn't much to stick around for unless you have deep pockets or want creative ideas.",0
"Your Mexican grammaw won't necessarily jump up and
down screaming ""¡Muy Auténtico!"" but this place still
delivers. Standard Mexican fare with pretty decent
service. If you check-in on Yelp, you get a 5 dollar

comes with the chips and salsa. Spicy and very flavorful.
And the Mango Margaritas - nice and stiff. Their entrees
are good especially the enchiladas. And I usually get
a side of the calabacitas. They're open till 11pm on
Fridays and Saturdays which is usually when I actually
make it over here. A late dinner after some event.

It was a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon with another foodie!",1

"OMG! I am so frustrated at this store, I have never met such an incompetent group of people in my entire shopping life. 

First, I called Fry's Electronics to check to see if they had a specific GPS model that worked in Europe. I called because I live at 115th Ave and Buckeye which is about 20miles from the nearest store. The call center informed me they did not carry that model but listed about 10 other GPS with maps of Europe. I asked again those models have maps of Europe? ""Yes and Australia too"". And you have those models in stock? ""Yes."" What is the price range? ""$100 to $300"". Thank you. FIRST MISINFORMATION! 

So I drove to  30th Ave and Thunderbird, talked with ""GPS Specialist"" (which apparently means nothing) and he (Jared) informed me they did not have any GPS units with European maps!! He said the call center ""is a bunch of retards"" and that those were all last years models. 

Then he called someone and looked at several GPS Units. When he did not know  if the unit had European maps or not he GOOGLED them! (okay not confident in your product knowledge). Then he sold me a $260 unit with European maps. SECOND MISINFORMATION. 

I drove all the way home and the GPS did not have European maps! I had to buy them for another $100 which I could have done with a cheaper GPS.

So I drive back to Fry's. Speak with a Supervisor, they return my first GPS. I speak with the same sales rep (ya thats great). He says he figured out 25min after I left that he sold me the wrong product and none of their GPS have european maps. 

So I then buy the cheapest model that was could download European maps, according the the sales rep Garmin NUVI 50Lm for $129.  THIRD MISINFORMATION. Because according to the Garmin site the NUVI 40Lm is also compatible and cheaper. 

I then went home bought the $100 European map and couldn't download it to my GPS because there wasn't enough space available!!!

Now I have to buy a miniSD Card and a miniSD reader for my Mac book. Awesome. Great to know that the electronic store knows nothing about electronics!",2
"Newly opened no frills supermarket import from the UK with interesting ethnic food selection.

The fruits and vegetables wrapped in clear plastic sitting on black crates reminds me of my neighborhood Tesco's from my days in London.
 
Cool thing about this one is the variety of products carried on the shelves.  When's the last time you're seen tripe or pig's feet at Albertson's or Safeway.  And hooray, I can finally buy Chaokoh (the only good brand of coconut milk) in Scottsdale without having to trek all the way down to Lee Lee's or Ranch Market. 

Great selection of fresh meats and cheeses.  The only place apart from Trader Joe's that I've seen unpasteurized orange juice, which by the way tastes way better because heat kills the fresh taste.

Much-needed addition to an area saturated by the boring standards.",1

But hey ... as long as I get that feel-good boost, I don't care. The fish and chips are also the best I've had in the Valley. And to think that I've previously been trying to get my fish 'n chips fix from the likes of Pete's ... yikes!

Great sales and service, a pretty solid seasonal selection but not as comprehensive as some of the larger Anthropologies out there. The person who lays out the stuff at this store seems to space out the perfume bombs at a wider spacing so sensitive noses may be less battered by this store than some others in the Valley.

The clearance racks are gold mines for sizes 8+. They occasionally have shoes, bags and swim items being sold at clearance there from in-store returns.

Getting past the $8-10 cover on weekends is the hard part, but usually Sail delivers, 1) AMAZING LOCAL BANDS, 2) Laid back hippie, hipster,arty, folk vibe 2) cheap drinks, LOVE the little pitchers of beer - budlite for $4.25 on certain nights. Phoenix has a pretty lame music scene, but at least at Sail Inn you can always find decent live music and a fun crowd.",1
"Very nice place with extremely friendly staff.  The food was similar quality to other Mexican food places in the NW Valley....good but not spectacular.   Very good portions for the price.  

I don't live close by but will certainly go back when I am in the area.",1
"This mall has all the upscale shopping that you will ever need. Just make sure you come here with your credit cards in check as you are bound to fall in love with something when you come here.

They have some of the best department stores in my opinion, and if you're looking for that perfect dress for any occasion, you have tons of options to choose from.

I love how clean and perfect this mall is!",1
"I really expected crappy food, because, after all, that's what sports bars generally offer.  Then I was told that the food was not bad, but good!  Which only made me eye my table mates suspiciously.  I ordered the tacos al carbon which comes with cilantro lime rice.  these are three street taco sized dealies that have steak in them and come with a little shot of pico and queso.

Now like I said, I expected crap.  But the tacos, with pico and queso poured on them, and grease dribbling out into a glorious puddle on the plate, were really amazingly good.  The steak bits were really tender--ordinarily in such a taco they'd be the tenderness of jerky.  Really: the tacos were totally sensational.

Also, we ordered a buffalo chicken flatbread which is essentially a pizza.  And it was great!  even with the bleu cheese, which I detest, this was a culinary delight.

So why the four stars, you ask?  two reasons.  One: the cilantro lime rice is offensively bad, like straight out of a box of rice-a-roni bad.  I would have preferred kibbles and bits as a side item.

And one other thing: it was happy hour and for a while they were serving beer OUT OF PITCHERS THAT WERE IN THE REFRIGERATOR INSTEAD OF STRAIGHT OUT OF THE TAP!  Capital crime.  Felonious.  In fact, Dante wrote about a circle of hell where all they did was serve beer out of pitchers instead of straight from the tap.

So you should know that although the beer serving would usually be a four star deduction and I'd never look back, I didn't drink beer tonight and so I really don't care if my table mates suffer.  But if you try that shit on me...

Four stars.  The food is really damn good.",1
"Yes, I'm a vegetarian reviewing a steakhouse, though I have eaten their steaks pre-veg. Their spinach salad is very good and filled with goodies such as goat cheese, dried cranberries, pecans, and mandarin oranges and is only a measly $6. I ordered the trio of sides which included some mushrooms, steamed asparagus and sweet potato fries. Our service was great, which typically it always is at The Keg. Big beers, nice sides, and for the meat eaters great steaks. Steakhouses should just offer a big ass portobello mushroom for vegs.",0
"What a shame this place is doomed. From a flavor perspective, I have never found such an interesting Asian/fusion style of food in a quick-serve setting. The food is remarkably rich and spicy, it's really refreshing to see a mass-market place be so bold. Being so deeply impressed initially, I really, really wanted to like this place. I have since given it about three or four tries. Yeah, not so much.

First of all, I'm not sure whether it's the quality of the meat, the parsimonious manner in which it's cut or some combination of the two, but their meat is always tough and stringy. When its breaded, the breading is inevitably chewy and hard because the meat inside the breading is so insubstantial that all the moisture gets sucked out in the frying process. Not even the chicken comes in substantial enough chunks to be juicy. 

The amusing thing is, what made me like this place at the outset was the delicious sauces. You're enjoying the sauces so much you can easily overlook how crappy the meat is. Alas, that will only take them so far, as time and time again you are reminded of the crappy meat as you are compelled to floss vigorously.

Portions are another issue. They're too small for the price. Instead of takeout containers overstuffed with rice and entrees, grandma-sized portions are stingily arranged on a small plastic plate. I never have a problem finishing my entire meal and I always wish there was more. 

I think Pick Up Stix has a bit of an identity crisis. On the one hand, they want to be Pei Wei, all flashy stainless steel and fancy real estate. On the other hand, come on folks, it's takeout faux-Chinese (""pick"" ""up"" - see what they did there?). The best takeout faux-Chinese is always known for generous portions at low prices. At Pick Up Stix, you unfortunately get neither.

The patronage reflects my opinion about the place each time I go: it's always nearly empty. I really don't expect it to last. That's a shame, I really will miss the unique flavor profiles.",2
"My boyfriend and I came here this past Friday night for dinner as we had both drive by the place quite often and have been wanting to try it out. 

The service was great and I liked the wide open space. We tried two different beer samples for a $1 each and settled on splitting a pitcher of Levitation which we both enjoyed.

We ordered the green chile dip appetizer. I ordered the shrimp tacos and my boyfriend ordered the brisket. He LOVED the brisket and after taking a bite of it, I could see why. It was quite good. My shrimp tacos however, were so bland that I barely ate half of my meal. And it was a ""small plate."" I wasn't the biggest fan of our appetizer but after tasting my dinner, I decided I liked the dip a lot more and finished it off. Definitely do not recommend the shrimp tacos.

One annoying thing was our meals came out right after our appetizer. A little time in between would have been good - but I'll take that over slow service any day. 

I'm giving this place four stars because of how great the brisket was and despite not liking my dish, I had a great time and think this place has lots of potential. I'll be back to try something else!",1
"I just thought I'd post an update.  I planned never to go back, but was with a friend who really wanted one of their breakfast items.  I skipped ordering ANY food whatsoever and merely ordered coffee and watched her eat.  As fate would have it, she had a BACK HAIR in her scrambled eggs (we are 2 for 2 now).  My gag reflex is going off as I type this.  My husband, friends, and I have renamed this place the Black Hair Diner, and we've decided they have actual black bears cooking in the kitchen, since they can't seem to keep black hairs out of their food.",2
"This Dunkin Donuts is hit or miss.

When i run in here for just coffee, the service is usually very fast and prompt. When i run in there to order coffee and food, that usually becomes a circus. There have been times when i've waited over 20 minutes for my food. Usually it's not a problem, but when you have a business meeting that you have to attend to, it is. 

Fast food, pffft. Bring a sleeping bag.",0
"I am glad that I remembered this place for brunch this past Saturday because it was good food and I love the atmosphere in the area as well.  I went with my BF and we put our name in, got some coffee and was seated quicker than the time the originally gave us, which is great in my book.  

I had the breakfast burrito with chorizo.  I wasnt a fan of it, it was good but not GREAT.  The chorizo really lacked flavor and punch...maybe I am use to the chorizo I get back home.  My bf had pancakes with ice cream on top of it and it looked amazing and he loved it.

I would come back and probably will to try some of there other things.  This is not a place to go to thinking you will get in and out quick, there are almost always people waiting but the walk around Old Town Scottsdale is worth it.",0
"I have been going to Cartel for a while, and their coffee has absolutely spoiled me. I can hardly drink coffee or esspresso from anywhere else, I even buy their beans and brew it at home.
Most of the bartista's are stellar, but expect to wait for your specialty drinks, not only because they are almost always busy, but also because making kick ass coffee drinks takes time.
I suggest either the Honduras with cream, an iced agave latter, or a cappuccino (which you have to drink there).",1
"Dinner for four at the soft opening.
The food kept us talking about the tastes and combinations far into the night.

Small/shared plates will fill you up quickly.  The Hamachi Crudo was a fresh, light starter with peppers, fennel and sea beans to fire up your appetite! Grilled asparagus and a delicate, cheesy risotto were great sides but the smoked beef rib was a taste sensation.  Sweet and savory, smoky and succulent, sticky and sumptuous! Bleu cheese grits and grilled peaches were the perfect pairing.  ahhhh, sigh.  I think I'd pass up the tater tots and save room for something else.  

This restaurant is just what Phoenix needs.  Close to the ball parks or walk off your dinner in an invigorated downtown, Blue Hound Kitchen is a great addition to the energy.",1
"I prefer this location to others in the valley.  Except for afternoon rush hour.  Dont go there between 3 and 6.  Unless youre a senior citizen, then its ok.  Youll fit right in.

I went for dinner and cant complain.  its your basic buffet, it seems like it has a larger selection than Ryans or JBs and the food quality is way better than both of those.  The brisket and beef tips were great, the only problem i had with the place was the wal mart environment (crying kids, way crowded, people acting like THAT steak was the last one ever made, etc) and i did make the mistake of going during grandma social hour, but aside from that, ill go back when Im craving 10 different things at once, which happens often :)

Dinner buffet for 2 runs a little under 30 bucks with drinks.",0

Great food!  Great atmosphere! Great service.  Definitely recommend!!,1
"I thought I was really in for one of the best burgers of my life due to my fellow Yelpers' reviews but was sort of disappointed.  I did like the fries in the shopping cart, that was pretty creative, but they weren't anything special.  Same way I felt about the Delux burger.  The meat was dry and the condiments were lacking which made it worse.  I thiknk the bun was the best part.  I did do a cool beer flight which was nice.  The atmosphere is pretty neat here but I probably won't visit again if I'm in the area.",2
"When I left this place the bartender threw her fist up in the air and told me to go take on the world. How cool is that?

I was impressed by how clean it was inside.  Plus they have craft beer on tap for $3.  Need I say more?",1
"T&S Glass did a wonderful job replacing my car window. They came right to the house within 2 hours of my call, had the window replaced within 30 minutes and treated me like a queen. Frank installed the glass and couldn't have been nicer. Thank you T & S Glass!!",1
"I love the food!! Love for the environment.. eh.. not so much.

Mom and I missed our reservation at Cowboy Ciao's on a Friday night and a worker recommended us to visit the sister restaurant ""Kazimierz."" Ok, we'll go as long as they have the famous Stetson Chopped salad. My mom loved the salad when she went to Cowboy Ciao.

So we enter the restaurant and the place is so dark. How the heck are you suppose to find a table and read the menu?? We had no idea how the seating worked, so we asked a worker. We were seating within a couple of minutes. Mann.. we had to hold up the candle to read the menu. The environment is nice if you are just spending time with your friends and chatting. But to eat and see your food?? The darkness is not good for that.

Anyway, we had the Stetson Chopped salad ($12). It was sooo good with the smoked salmon, dehydrated corn, pepita mixture, and the greens. Yummy!

The Burgundian Flatbread ($13) was also delicious! I liked the crispy crust and the chunks of brie!! Wow!! The morels and the shallots gave the flatbread some sweetness.

Since I liked the food, I'll give this place 4 stars. However, I wish I could see what I was eating. Thank goodness I took a picture of what I was ingesting. 

The service and atmosphere is more like 3 stars.",1
"Need fig preserves? They've got it. Fennel? It's beautifully packed on ice and extremely fresh in the produce department. Need boneless pork loin roast from the blade end? The butcher has your back. Duck fat? Just take a peek in the freezer section. Sometimes, it's the little things that normally go unnoticed that gets you five stars...

AJ's closed early the other night in lieu of the holidays and I ran around to FOUR different stores looking for something as simple as whole grain mustard and fennel. I came up empty handed on both items. I say ""simple"" items - but it's amazing when you rely on a grocer like this as much as I do and realize that most items are out of reach otherwise. AJ's carries practically anything my culinary desires could ask for!

Although I had to wait a day to go shopping again and to make the recipe i was wanted, it was during my adventures to the 4 stores that I realized how much I truly appreciate this grocer. How is it I can get wireless internet via laptop on the I-10 freeway courtesy of my phone company, but can't find fennel within a 10 mile radius?

This my friends, is why I love AJ's. And as someone who watches America's Test Kitchen as though it were food porn, I can say that any other grocer doesn't stand a chance against Eddie Bashas' high end store.

You truly do get what you pay for. For all the employees at AJ's I say ""THANK YOU!!"" for the great service you provide and the products you offer.",1
"This place is a dream.  Designer blouses for $17.00.  Seven jeans and Hudson jeans for $20.  Steve Madden shoes for $25.  I could go on... the store is beautiful, well-organized and full of things that are in perfect or near-perfect condition.  Some items are still quite pricey, but most of the store is extremely reasonably priced.  

If you need something new very quickly for a date or an interview or a special occasion, you will probably find it here.  The employees are nice, friendly, helpful and the dressing rooms are good as well.  Love it!",1
"I love boba drinks but hate the word ""boba"". I always feel like an ape when I say that word. 
 
Anyways.

There was a period where I use to drink this stuff at least 3 times a week when I was living in San Francisco, so when I say I love something, I really do (or is it more like a creepy obsession?) So! When I found a boba place here I got excited, especially when I saw that they had green milk tea.

I can't vouch for all of their drinks, as I've only tried the green milk tea and avocado snow, but every time I have ordered them they have been super good.",1
"I need to stop going here so much, but it's hard to stay away.",1
"The noise makes it almost impossible to talk. The staff looks like the customers or the customers are better dressed. Staff is wrinkled, sunglasses on the back of their head, it's hard to know who you supposed to ask for help. Once you know, they are responsive, friendly and willing to please.

The food is fair, dressings, sauced are too watered down. The food is minimal in terms of amounts for the money. It is a favorite among the neighborhood but these are now the adults whom hung out at the old Monastery behind Whitney & Murphy funeral home. I am beginning to think my fellow Az peeps have no idea what good casual food is about. The service in AZ is terrible, all of customer service in businesses here is terrible, restaurants and retail.
watch out for the Valets, they drive customers cars too fast around the parking lot, here and Arcadia Tavern!


I am entitle to my opinion since I have worked my way through school as a waitress/bartender , valet service manager and service consultant.

"I am furious.

In the last 12 months, I have had at least scheduling issues, from them calling me at 8AM on a Saturday morning (my 1 day off) to cancel my 11am appointment to last Saturday, when I went in only to be told someone had messed up, and actually booked me for the NEXT week, and despite me driving all the way out there at 11am, they couldn't get me in until maybe that evening, and then not with someone who had experience in deep tissue/medical massage. I was irritate and ready to ask for my membership refunded then, but Ashley the clinic manager promised me that they'd give me my next week appointment free of charge, and that she'd personally be certain there were no more issues.  As I literally couldn't turn my head to the left due to pain, I took her up on that. BIG MISTAKE.

Yesterday (the Friday before my ""correctly"" scheduled massage, I went out of my way to call in and confirm my own bloody appointment, to try and avoid last week's debacle. According to the woman who answered the phone, it looked like my schedule therapist was actually scheduled off, but she went to talk with her manager, and came back to the phone telling me everything was ok, and that she'd call with any issues. Then yesterday evening, I got ANOTHER confirmation call from Massage Envy, confirming and reminding me of my 11:30am appt on Saturday with my preferred therapist. GIven that I've had 3 migraines this week (versus my 0 or 1 when I get a massage the weekend prior), I really absolutely needed to get in, so I felt more confident.

Well, I was just woken up at 8am...again. On my day off...again. To explain to me that, big shock, they messed up my scheduling again, and that apparently, my therapist was off today. Despite Ashley's promise of it not happening again. Despite me being pro-active and calling to confirm. I am sitting here in pain, so furious at this repeated treatment that I can't even go back to bed...and the best part? They don't even have a manager on duty I can complain to.

My treatment at the hands of the booking/front desk staff has been any thing BUT relaxing. I continue to walk out of there frustrated, angry, and occasionally in tears. I know they say Fool Me Once, Shame On You, Fool Me Twice, Shame On Me, but I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. I'm pretty screwed for today and the next week, but luckily, an Elements place with a similar concept opened recently in the general area. At this point, it literally cannot be any worse than massage envy. As much as I love Talisha and Aisha as massage therapists, getting a massage should feel good, and not like you're just a number to them, not like you actually have to spend more time trying to get a damn appointment than you actually get to spend IN the appointment.",2
"I mostly buy mountian house and other camping foods from REI, they have a huge selection to choose from, including biscuits and gravy. don't expect 5 star restraunt food, but on those long days at a Military range Mountain house beats the pants off MRE's not to mention you could eat 3 mountain house meals and be about where a MRE is. I've been drooling over several other items at the store, I'd like to go backpacking sometime and they have tons of little things that could make things a little more tolerable for either Military operations, or camping/ backpacking.",1
"I love that Goober will deliver direct to your door!!  The are affordable, convenient and include free bones with your order.

"So, yesterday morning, I actually had a prego craving.  I was in the mood for a smoothie for breakfast.  My traditional early morning oatmeal or yogurt breakfast was not going to do.  Baby wanted something else.  

I head on over to this Jack-in-the Box, which is close to work.  I pull up, order my strawberry banana smoothie, and am promptly told that the ""machine is broken"".  Uh...well that sucks!  I pull up to the window and the person tells me that the machine is leaking (at least I think that's what he said).  But would be about 10 minutes and it would be up and running.  

Now knowing the smoothie issues I had this morning, I dont think that the machine was broken.  The product just wasnt ready yet.",2
"Update: As of Feb 2010 this place closed because the owners got in a bitch fight.

I live right next door to this place at Shade.  I go often enough, great happy hour.  Prices are pretty cheap ($5ish for the various happy hour sushi rolls), service is pretty fast, and it's great that it's locally owned and not a chain restaurant.  

Only ""negative"" comment is it' is a bit small inside, hard to accommodate large groups of more than 8, and even that is pushing it if they are busy.  If you can go before everyone gets off work, it's pretty quiet in there, and fun to sit at the sushi bar as well.",1
"My co-workers and I refer to this place as ""Pizza n' Ants"".  The staff will be happy to serve you with bare hands, right after using the till.  Also, as the nickname suggests, there has been a noticable insect problem.

This place is similar to Rays on 3rd St. It was lunch time I had an eggplant parm sub very good the eggplant was nicely breaded not gooey and gross. The kid had a slice of cheese the slices are HUGE. The pizza and service here are always good. I suggest this place for dinner more so the meals are way better they come with a house salad and they have more options pasta and such. They deliver too.,1
"Mellow Mushroom - WOW

As you may tell from recent reviews, I have been on a Pizza crusade. Well, I took a friend to Mellow Mushroom today and the pizza rocked.

We shared the Thai Die Pizza which had curry chicken and tasted awesome. The crust was think and delicious the pizza burst with taste when I bit into it. I am a traditional pizza guy but this diversion worked.

Great service and a nice patio to eat topped it off.

"I went here on a Saturday night and sat outside listening to the band playing in the background.  It was part of the Music Under the Stars, or whatever it called, very cool and fun though.  BTW, I see a lot of people commenting on how loud it was, to all you yelpers, take that with a grain of salt, it's a pizza place near a large family residential area on a weekend, what do you expect, I guess it's an expectation thing.  By no means is this going to be a quiet candlelit dinner for two.  It's a classy, family oriented pizza place. 

We ordered the caesar salad and small pepperoni pizza. Very well priced, and the pizza in my opinion tasted delicious.  It seems like everybody has some weird opinion on how good pizza is, and I guess I have a weird opinion as well.  Here goes...the size of the small, is not small it was more like a medium (value! winning!)(sorry lame Charlie Sheen pop culture reference) anyway, it had a faint sweet taste on it which i really like, the cheese was good, not too much sauce, and the pepperonis were very flavorful.  They were the small kind and they were just great.  The Salad was good, salad is salad, it's hard to mess that up.  

We were helped by an awesome bartender/server named Chandler.  Cool guy, really nice, he kept us entertained.  

We'll be back I want to try some kind of meatlovers next time we go there.",1

"In the age old debate of length v. girth, Sky Harbor is clearly a proponent of length. I swear this airport is three miles long.

"Came here with the hubs- and we love the place :)  We were able to eat here for significantly less dinero than you typically spend at any other sushi restaurant.  The food comes by on the conveyer belts and the items are price coded by the color plate they are on.  At the end of your meal you just add up the plates for your total.  Each plate comes with 4-6 pieces of sushi- and they also have salads, desserts, appetizers, etc on the belt.  If you are afraid that the sushi has been on the belt for too long or there is something else that you would like that isn't currently on display you can order direct from the bar.  Win win :)",1
"this is my favorite music venue in phoenix. it is a smaller venue best for local or indie bands, but every show i've been to their has been far more memorable then any show i've been to in phoenix.

the place itself isn't too stunning, it is just a rectangular brick building with a bar area on the right when you walk in, booths on the left side of the wall, some high tables in the middle, a stage and standing area at the back, and an eclectic mix of art on the walls. however, the place has a really good feel to it and excellent sound that leads to really wild and memorable concerts.

the two that i remember the most were the presets/the rapture and spinto band/art brut/we are scientists. i thought the presets were pretty lousy until i saw them play there and the rapture played an absolutely amazing set that lasted almost 2 hours and inspired an epic, comfortably out-of control dance party. the other show was equally long and boisterous, highlighted by eddie argos coming out into the crowd to sing 3 songs.

the bad things about the place are that last time i went there was still no alcohol because they lost their liquor license. however, i heard that they have got it back now, but i'm not sure. the shows i went to i had to go down the street between sets and drink at alice cooperstown which isn't cheap. 

it also doesn't have a patio at all where you can hang out and hear the music or what is going on inside and drink or smoke. the venue reminds me alot of the lounge in the back of Plush in tucson except for the lack of a patio which is really important in a state like AZ where the weather is so good at night most of the year.

of course the worst thing is just the lack of bands that go there. most bands come to either marquee (heaven help us poor phoenicians) or even worse, the clubhouse. if you happen to be a tour manager reading reviews on yelp, please book your band at the brickhouse.

Update - 8/31 - Had to downgrade to 4 stars after my most recent visit. Its hard to believe that I'm downgrading them now that they have liquor available, but it's happening. 

They normally have local draft brews at this place for 2 dollars, but apparently when they have a show they don't sell it at all. Only bottles for 3 or 4 dollars. What's worse is that every bottle I ordered wasn't cold, tasted like they just threw it in the ice bin 30 minutes before. AND they kept running out of beers. What's even worse is that the mixed drinks run 6 DOLLARS for a really tiny glass. This place needs to get its act together. I'll be drinking beforehand and elsewhere in between sets from now on. I don't get why the music venues in Phoenix don't understand how much more money they can make at a show with drink specials.

They also apparently haven't invested in air conditioning which makes summer shows not even worth it. Okkervil River still put on a great show to my surprise, which is the only thing (along with the other great shows i've seen there) that kept me downgrading this place to 3 stars or lower.

They are also in the middle of remodeling so the place looks kindof like crap right now.",1
"Moira isn't the best sushi I've ever had, but for Phoenix and my neighborhood and the pricepoint (as long as we don't order alcoholic beverages) is doable when we get a sushi craving. 

The happy hour is a great benefit if you can get away from work before it ends.  

Their spicy rolls are definitely spicy, and have some great kick to them.
It hits the spot without breaking the bank and we'll take it.",0
"New and big yes... but not my favorite spring training park.

5 stars for being big and roomy and also lots of grass in the outfield

2 stars for being almost like a major league park. Feels like you are attending a MLB regular season game. They lost out on the small spring training feel and intimacy.

0 stars for being the only cactus league park I visited this spring not allowing you to bring in food like candy or peanuts or sunflower seeds. You realize why when you see the pricey beer and food vendors inside.",2
Nobuo shows his unique talents with everything on the menu. Carefully crafted features with much to drink. Start with the pork belly buns and a stout. Then go on until you can no longer.,1
Had the meat pizza last night and it was truly one of the best pizzas I've had in a long time.  The owner is always very welcoming and warm hearted!,1
"I have been to a great many Ross store-- and I can safely say that this one is my favorite. Even when it is busy, it is still manageable, unlike some of the others. 

I am also consistently pleased with their selection. Now, I often go in there without much of a purpose, just to see what's there-- but I recently found ALL, that's right, all of my Christmas gifts. Perhaps I went in on a lucky day, but I can't think of a time when I didn't walk out of there with at least something.

I was sorry to read the previous review, because I have had such a consistently good time at this store. As for the store having a security guard, the one who works most of the time is a kick in the pants. He'll chat with you if given the opportunity. Also, every Ross has at least one, if not two, security guards working while the store is open. 

I hope more of you are encouraged to visit now that you know what a great time I have had there. It's one of the smaller Ross stores that I have been in, but it certainly packs a punch. Happy bargaining!",1
"I dined here last week with my wife and in-laws and, I gotta say, it doesn't get much better.  Ambiance was dark but classy.  Loved the music (no dated Rat Pack stuff here).  Started the evening with their amazing Trio of Duck Fat Fries.  The truffle emulsion may have been the best sauce I've ever had in my life!  Only got better from there: Shellfish tower was loaded with goodies and all tasted straight from the ocean!  For entrees, my wife got the Trio of Kobe Beef and I had the Fried Chicken for two.  One of the top meals I've ever had in my life.  The chicken was so moist an came with a truffle mac & cheese and onion jus.  I did say it was for two but it was so good that i refused to share.  My wife couldn't stop talking about the Kobe Trio.  

But, I gotta say, the best part of the experience was the staff.  Knowledgeable just isn't enough to describe the service here.  They care about every single detail, never missing one.  The Sommelier made excellent wine recommendations (and each one well within my price range) and never skipped a beat when it came to pouring for the table.  The server was as professional as professional gets and the Manager seemed to always be there to pull out a chair or provide a fresh napkin.  Flawless.

Well done Bourbon Steak!",1
"Economical discount theater!  For the price of what other theaters charge just for admission, you can get your popcorn and drink too!  Seats are a little small, but there are usually plenty of them.  It is of course not the newest releases, but I am never up to date on my movie watching anyway.  Must have cash, ATM available in the lobby area.",1
"I've been going to Unique since I was little.... when it was called Chic n' Cheap. I always find at least one decent thing at Unique. Granted it doesn't have tons of great stuff, but it is a great stop on a shopping day. And this isnt a psudeo thrift store that more of a vintage store and therefore can charge non-thrift prices. I'm talking shirts under a dollar. yeah.",1
"This place has potential but I didn't care for the layout.  Long bar is neat but instead of all the small tv's they should have put in bigger one's and spread them out.  The large screens are neat, but sitting in the uncomfortable chairs sitting to close to them was bad planning.  I believe the owner is a Sooners fan so that game rules over others, even Devils games.  The volume wasn't on for the Devils game, wth.  Waitress was lazy, didn't come by the table often.  Chicken Tenders were good, with sweet and sour sauce.  Sweet Potato Fries are gross, doesn't taste anything like 'em.  I'd go to hang out and not expect much in the future.",2
"LOVE LOVE LOVE riding my bike through here.  Especially on our way back, with all the down hills!!!!  It's like a roller coaster but better!!!!

I also drive through here every morning to get to work, so that is a nice, relaxing, pretty way to start my day.",1
Dr. Lee does excellent work and he and the staff are very friendly and professional.  The best dental care I have ever received and I have lived all over the country and grew up at the dentist with my bad teeth.  They work very well with children also.,1
"Totally worth the drive from Scottsdale. The food is delicious, and is not pre-packaged, such a nice change for a coffee joint. Support local business, Starbucks has nothing on Lux; other than a million locations.",1
"I found this place in Yelp, so I at least started with some optimism ;) I wasn't disappointed. Great portions and plenty of variety. Got egg rolls, mu shu pork, house low mein,  Mongolian beef, rice and 4 fortune cookies, soy sauce, and hot
mustard for about $30 plus tip. Plenty of leftovers after stuffing myself ;)  Everything tasted as expected, though the egg rolls and Mongolian beef were better than most... Not crazy great, but really good for take out/delivery. Now if they only made Chinese turkey for Christmas!!",1
"I am so not a fan of the dentist.  But Dr. Ito and his staff changed that.  Professional, yet relaxed attitudes.  From the moment you book the appointment to the time you leave you feel like are well cared for and that you aren't just a number or a dollar sign.

While in the waiting area I flipped through Dr. Ito's ""Smile"" book that shows some of his work.  WOW!  He makes teeth look real, not like Chiclets.  He does some fabulous cosmetic work!  

I went in to have a crown put on and it was quick and painless. So quick that I didn't get to finish watching the movie!   Each chair has headphones and a flat screen that shows a movie (he keeps a good stock of the latest movies.).  Who'd have thought that going to the dentist would keep me so entertained?

I've had to bring my son to each appointment as I haven't had anyone to keep him.  Does that matter? Nope.  Dr. Ito's office is equipped with a children's area in the back where the kids can watch a movie, read a book or play a game.  He thinks of everything.

I have been recommending him to everyone I meet.  I can't say enough good things about Dr. Ito and his staff.  You won't regret going to the dentist if Sonoran Hills Dental is your new dental office.",1
"Good vibe - and outstanding location - they definitely work well with a large group (10), delivering orders to the right person without asking ""who gets ...""  LOVE THAT KIND OF SERVICE.  And not once, NOT ONCE, did the service people call any of our group ""guys"" (okay, okay, a pet peeve of mine).  Horseradish potatoes are a bit salty -- and prime rib serving is definitely less than generous.  That said -- the fish and chips were great, as were (according to one of our party) the pork and beans.  Desserts are HUGE -- share with 2 or 3 others.",0
"When was the last time that you went to a restaurant and were still bragging about your experience two weeks later??? This is exactly what I am doing about the ""Arrogant Butcher.""

I went there a couple of weeks ago with a bunch of folks from work. We had a private dining area and our servers name was Mark. He truly made the experience AMAZING!  His detailed, vivid descriptions of the entrees and desserts were comical and had most of us in tears. You could almost smell and taste each item as he passionately went into detail.  The appetizer- soft pretsels with cheese..OH EM GEE!!!!!!!!  Why doesn't every restaurant have these??? The crab stuffed chicken......AMAZING!

We shared several desserts, one which was a peanut butter cup......stand back Reese's......you have competition now!! =)

The manager came in later and had a professional, yet funny, manner about him as well.  What a great team they are.",1
"We were taken here by our host in Phoenix.  It's one of the prettiest Mexican restaurants I've been in, with a courtyard surrounding a duck pond (there is a sign requesting you not feed the ducks tortilla chips!).

The margaritas were great and my chicken was excellent, as were my partner's tequila shrimp.  Would definitely go back there if I were to visit Phoenix again.",1
"It is a total dive bar...If you need a drink go get one.  There are pool tables, shuffle board, video game or two, and a jukebox.  The bartenders know their stuff.  Enough said!",0
"I love this place. I'm mostly here at dinner time to pick up my favorite roasted turkey artichoke panini and sometimes salad and soup as well! The staff is super friendly and recognize when my boyfriend and I show up, maybe because he can never leave without getting a dozen of their amazing cookies! The manager Kaylee is fabulous, she makes us feel right at home and is never unsatisfactory. They may have a smaller parking lot but I guess I have always had good luck with finding a spot! I know I will continue to come back for more.",1
"Just isn't very good.

I don't understand why people give this place even three stars.  It's rare for me to give a place a low rating, but, My Big Fat Greek restaurant is nothing but gimmick anymore and has gone from bad to worse.   The food is not even close to any representation of what good Greek food tastes like.

I've been to this place several times over the years.  This location and others.   It used to be just on the lower end of OK...  it's never been as good as you can get from a 'Ma and 'Pa place.  However, we went for lunch the other day and it's just gotten to the point I wouldn't even go back for a quick bite.

We ordered the garlic hummus, and it was overly full of garlic and not home made.  It seemed to be loaded with garlic powder, as opposed to fresh hummus that just had roasted garlic in it.   The olives we ordered were rough at best.  UGH even thinking about them.  Overly seasoned and not very fresh.   The rice was over cooked and was so soft it lacked any sort of texture.

The first rule of good let, alone great food, is FRESH.   This place needs a rescue.

Less critical, but, I think an overall representation of what has happened to the place, the menu's were totally trashed.   As in ratty, tattered, and dirty.  The lamination was coming off them and they were dirty. 

Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.",2
"Holy frijoles- this place lived up to the hype. I'm surprised how how good the pizza is here in Arizona. Very tasty, and definitely some of the best pizza I've had in the valley. The only downside is that there is usually a long wait to be seated, and then once your seated, it takes a longer wait for your pizza. The prices are average, the service was so-so, but the food was excellent! Nice location too, right in Old Town so you can have a drink at a nearby bar while you wait for your table. Cool place for date-night, or to have dinner with family. It's fairly casual, but charming at the same time.",1
"One of those places that can not possibly serve bad food...! Lunch, specifically, is very nice, quick and affordable... All their curries as well as entrees are equally good and you can ogfcourse adjust the level of spice as in all Thai places... ( that's something I don't like but serves good for those who don't eat spicy food)... Thai coffee is one of my favourites too...",1
"Lame joke alert :
Okay, I think I have switched over to Switch , I am finally making a switch to Switch  whew almost over , after you try Switch you'll never switch.  And done.

Thanks for letting me get that out of my system.Lunch today was delightful. Mom and I were downtown playing around and we tried Switch for something new.  Glad we did.  

Our server Matthew was helpful, courteous and efficient. He really made the good food stand out .  For being at the peak of lunchtime it was nice to see the restaurant wasn't packed but they were well prepared for the lunchtime crowd.Food was served fast without feeling rushed. Drinks were filled promptly without hovering.


We had the Beef Galletta , a puff pastry with mushrooms, tender beef, brie , onions and a light sauce. Great size not too much but definitely filling.  Mom had chicken chop salad that looked fresh and tasty.  She really enjoyed it.   I look forward  to coming back and trying other items here.",1
"I love a place that lets me do whatever I want. I can go to this place and scarf down a whole bunch of pretty good tasting frozen yogurt for 160 some-odd calories. I can pig out on Thrifty Brand Ice Cream - oh joy! I can pretend I am in Hawaii and have shave-ice (snow cones to mainlanders). I can get a puppy cup of frozen yogurt for my dog. How COOL is THAT??? I can get quarts of stuff to bring home. AND - here's the big one....the people are actually really, really nice! Okay - I've read the other reviews - the frozen yogurt is good - nothing that will drive you to ecstacy - but good enough to hit that ""I need something cold and frozen"" spot. My dog loves the lo-cal treat. So, depending on the Length of my hike, it is yogurt, ice cream, sometimes both......you get double punches on Wednesday and the puppy cup is free if you bring your puppy.",1
"I am a G-Spot addict!  Had to limit myself from going every week though.  

Took the hubby there after a date night the other weekend.  It was his first time to try gelato.  He's a ColdStone guy 100% and he really enjoyed the Tiramisu gelato!  

The focaccia flatbread is awesome!!!  And I would post a photo of the Focaccia Flatbread I got earlier to eat along with my homemade salad, but (in the words of LOLCat) ""I eated it"" and forgot to take a photo first.   :)

My favorite salad dressing is the champagne vinegarette!  
The mintchip gelato is freaking awesome!  
The stracciatella gelato mixed with mint - even better!!!  

G-Spot is so awesome, that I just walked back over and got my Mint / Stracciatella combo.  Baby C wanted something sweet!   :D",1
"I really wanted to fall madly in love with this place, I mean, a British themed pub in Heritage Square? So promising. 

As you walk in, the bartender is standing behind in an elaborate wooden bar structure. This made me think publican instead of bartender (as in ""Mate, I'll take a pint and d'ya have any rooms available?""), which is probably the idea. As there was nice selection of draught beers, we walked around to the bar to the right and ordered a couple of pints. I ordered a Boddingtons, my friend ordered a Stateside micro brew. (Would have been nice if they had Old Peculiar on tap, but you can't have everything.) 

Due to the combination of things cooking in the kitchen, it smelled a bit like my grandma's house. This prompted us to make a beeline for the patio decorated with super-heavy wood furniture. I assume this is to discourage thieves from selling their tables and chairs on the black market. Smart. The piped-in music selection that night was a bit off-putting, in fact, one of the other patrons commented on it as well. It appeared to be a satellite radio station that specialized in 80s hits like Wham! and Depeche Mode. I guess George Michael and David Gahan ARE British. Indeed! Wikipedia just informed me that ""Dave Gahan (born May 9, 1962 in Epping, Essex, England) is the baritone lead singer for the English electronic band Depeche Mode, and is also an accomplished solo artist."" Now I feel better. 

There are many cozy nooks in this place, so that would be a good thing if you wanted to have some one-on-one time. They were also playing football (soccer) on the flat screens, so should make some team scarf-wearing Brit ex-pats in the Valley very happy.

Will I be back to try the food? Probably at some point. But, for another round of drinks, I think I'll wait for a Friday or Saturday night when it's hopping.",0
"Great bar with a friendly bartender named ""Bob""",0
The salad plates were not chilled... As they usually are it however is a busy night but something's are expected at the olive garden... The food tasted like it was under a hot lamp for so long it tasted almost hard and also under cooked for the seafood... Not a great experience at the olive garden there are certain things expected... The expectations are not that high shouldnt be that hard to do....,2
"The pizza is incredible, they use really high quality ingredients and the prices are great. I would recommend cooking it on the bottom rack of your oven for a slightly better texture on the crust.

I want someone to mark that this post is funny, so I will add a joke:

Mushroom walks into a bar... Bartender says, ""sorry, we don't serve your type here."" Mushroom says ""why not? I'm a fungi (fun guy).""",1
"pretentious and bad service - attendants are totally clueless (though I feel for them if management makes them wear the costumes they wear). overpriced fashion brands.  if you want to spend $200 on a flannel, there are MUCH better options out there.  run in and glance at the sale rack, otherwise avoid this place like the plague.",2
I don't get it. This place is crazy busy with no Manager in sight and in hiding during the busy dinner hour. No name tags on the employees. I was scolded for pointing over the sneeze glass to the sauce that I wanted since nothing was labeled. I guess I violated the health code. Thanks for not locking me up. I told my family we will not spend one more dime here.,2
"This place could be great, and I've always wanted to like it more than I actually do.  Occasionally, I have stopped into Mill's End for breakfast, specifically because they have crepes on their menu; in fact, their breakfast menu is actually fairly extensive for a small cafe.  For reasons explained below, lately I've found myself just walking past Mill's End, no longer considering giving it my business.  The general issues that I have with this place involve just a couple of basic things; if the owners made the effort to correct these, I believe Mill's End could be a great cafe.

I have always thought there are three factors that can make a cafe stand out from its competitors.  It is with all three of these that Mill's End falls short: 

1)Ambience.  This means that the environment must be suitable both for studying/reading, as well as relaxation.  So, the music playing needs to be something that is non-intrusive and that the customers can generally ignore; sometimes Mill's End has this covered, but other times not at all.  Onto the seating.  It seems that this cafe was decorated back in 1995, in an attempt to capture the coziness of the cafe on the TV show ""Friends;"" unfortunately, they didn't come close, but there is usually plenty of seating open.  By the way, what is up with pseudo-sexual ice photography on the walls?

2)Price.  This is actually my number one problem with Mill's End.  The coffee is reasonably priced, but the food is too expensive.  Anytime I tell someone that I ate there, it's always the same response, ""yeah, their food is good, but it's really pricey.""  Considering that this place is literally ten feet from a major light rail stop, I imagine that their business has gone up, but those prices sure haven't dropped.

3.Customer service.  The staff has always been just lukewarm.  Look, I don't expect the staff in cafes and restaurants to be smiling like idiots all of the time, I only want to feel welcomed with a bit of hospitality; this has just always been kind of lacking at Mill's End.

Honestly, I think this place has a lot of potential, but it seems to be awash in complacency.",2
"Love this place, sushi is good and great customer service!",1
"Their happy hour is crazy cheap!!!

The scene though is like a poor mans Rehab/Wet Republic, but I'm not mad! It gets really crackin there especially on the weekends (suffice to say, I was only there for a weekend hahaha). This is definitely a spot to checkout while in Scottsdale!",1
This place is delicious. Great food and when they cook in front of you they do a lot of cool tricks and stuff. I would eat there everyday if I could afford it.,1
"Tried to eat here Friday night for the seafood buffet. We waited in line for 90 minutes before finally giving up. Would have been much sooner but the drive down there from my house is almost an hour. 

They have three lines, tiered based on the level of player's club card. The diamond card holders waltzed right in and the hostesses would seat from that line until it was empty before anyone from the 'lesser' lines would be seated. At the end, we stood still... didn't move an inch... for 20 minutes. So no-one from our line was seated for 20 minutes while dozens of people waltzed right through in the diamond and platinum lines. 

What a fucking joke. Waster my whole evening trekking down there dreaming of crab legs just to be snubbed by them.

Never, EVER again.",2
"Inside the Clarendon Hotel in central Phoenix, Gallo Blanco has quickly made a hit for themselves with hipsters and urban dwellers alike. They offer a refreshing alternative for hotel restaurants, with lively ambiance and great food and drink.

Gallo Blanco's tacos are surefire hits. They're served individually, and come lined up in an appealing silver taco stand. We've ordered the carne asada and shrimp soft tacos, and, wow, they're really mouthwatering. The shrimp is flame grilled and seared, bringing out a nice full flavor. The guacamole is slightly sweet and chunky, and paired with outstanding tortilla chips, this is a must-order appetizer. Even the sauces (I prefer the red chipotle one) are addictive, either to accompany the supreme tacos, or to be enjoyed alone on chips.

This restaurant is a fine addition to the emerging downtown Phoenix foodie scene, and with prices extremely reasonable, you get a lot. A good sized meal for two (sans drinks) could ring up at $30-35, which is a good value for great food. Try Gallo Blanco, bring friends, and get a bunch of items. Although I haven't explored the rest of the menu, I sense that Gallo Blanco's items don't stray far from excellence.",1
"I ordered takeout from here recently...and it was delicious! I phoned in my order during a busy dinner time, so it was a bit chaotic and the food took a longer than they had quoted me, but it was worth the wait. I had the imperial rolls, which are like veggie-filled non-greasy egg rolls, and the pad thai. I wasn't sure about a vegetarian pad thai without chicken/shrimp, but neither was missed because the flavor was amazing. Definitely will be ordering food from here again--just maybe during a less busy time.",1
"2 stars because I really did like the eye doctor I saw, she was awsome.  

Thought I was off to a good start getting new glasses.  I picked out my frames while I waited to be taken care of.  

Oh...wait...the eye glass gods had something else in store for me.  

The person helping me couldn't get an authorization code from my insurance company because it was afterhours.  He actually told me I had to pay full price or come back tomorrow.  Now keep in mind that I have had this insurance forever, never had any problems before; after hours, weekends, etc.  So I used my cell and called the insurance company.  I get someone on the phone who is trying to help us.  I put eyemaster guy on the phone and he actually got into a fight with the woman on the phone, handed it back to me and said here you talk to her, I'm done.  

So the lady got me the authorization code and a explaination that this doesn't happen because most eye glass providers can take care of everything in spite of the insurance company being closed and she also asked me if I was sure I shouldn't switch eyemaster locations due to this guys behavior.  

But I thought I was done.  I have my glasses picked out and I needed them to drive.  So while she was talking to me the guy at eyemasters was throwing out insults loud enough that the lady could hear.  

So I lost 1/2 hour of my time and think the worst is over

Well...those darn eye glass gods...I can't get them in an hour because it was too late in the day the guy tells me.  He has the right lens and it was only 6:00 pm,  come back tomorrow.  

So I called today and was told 1/2 hour and they will be ready.  I drive over there on my lunch hour and guess what.  They aren't even close to being ready.  So I walk around the mall, come back and guess what, only 1 pair is ready.  That would normally be ok but the attitude of the two guys working is arrogant and not very customer friendly.  I laugh it off and leave.  

So what are the odds I'll get my glasses after work today???  One can only wonder.  Awful service, unprofessional and unpleasant to experience.",2
"Lunch was delicious, as usual. I had the bruschetta trio for the first time and I couldn't find anything wrong with it, much as I tried to. Not even the onions bothered me. And if you know me, you know how much I hate onions. But their bruschetta was so full of all my favorite flavors I couldn't even complain about the onions. Now that's saying something.",1
"What a great find! Located off of Yelp after a business meeting in the area & we were hungry before we hit the road. Very comfortable space, lighting is good so you can see each other & your food which is not always the case. The decor is not overwhelming but extremely comfortable, some TV's, Thai decor & more pop music on the overhead. The staff was extremely attentive from the moment we walked in through out the meal. My Jasmin iced tea never got to the bottom. The menu has great variety. The pad Thai was excellent as were the vegetarian rolls. The Tom Ka soup was excellent. Every member of our group got something different and they were all extremely happy. We will be back. Pricing was very reasonable. There is patio seating available. Check it out.",1
"I had never been to Dominick's and I like trying new restaurants so I was excited to check it out.  We had a reservation for 8 pm on Saturday night and when we showed up the restaurant was busy.  It definitely is catering to those that want to be seen and show off what they have.  As we were walking up they had 6-7 of your finest vehicles backed in right next to the front door.

Calling it a front door is a little misleading however.  I found it interesting for such a nice restaurant to have a revolving door as there entrance.  Once inside the door you are greeted by what is a darkened ""Liberace"" type decor.  Think big chandeliers and crushed velvet.  We were seated promptly for our 8 pm reservation.

Top line the food was mediocre.  We between the 4 of us we ordered the  Scallops, Halibut, and the Ribeye as our entrees.  For our sides we ordered the potatoes, gnocchi, and creamed corn as our sides.  The main issue that we all had with the food was that it was very salty.  At one point my buddy across the table asked me "" does yours taste really salty?"". I answered yes and everybody else chimed in that theirs was quite salty as well.  I don't know if the chef was having a bad night but if not he needs to pump the brakes on his salt usage!

Finally this place isn't the cheapest place.  I am not one to complain about prices and I eat at fine dining restaurants on a weekly basis as part of my job.  Our bill for the 4 of us was $500.  We did have a couple drinks a piece but the price we paid did not match the quality of food we received.

My advice is to check out the bar for a few drinks and enjoy the people watching.  Think Phoenix Open.  Otherwise if you are looking for a good steakhouse head across the street to Ocean Club.",2
"I love the girls there. I get my eyebrows done every two weeks and I get my nails done there as often as I can. Recently, I just did the gel nails (just the gel polish not like the fake nail stuff) and I LOVE it. I can't tell you how happy I am that I did it. I always just did my toes because I'd always manage to goof up my fingernails in the first hour after I get them done- but with gels, you can't do that because after they're put under the UV Light, they dry immediately. No goof ups! Plus, they don't chip. The lady said they'd last around two weeks. I'm so happy with them. It's been a week and they still look pretty good. :)",1
"I want very badly to love this bar.  I really do.  It has all the promising combinations of qualities I look for in a local locale.  

Great beer.  I have no qualms about ordering the French Canadian Hefeweizen (that I can't even pronounce, spell or at this moment recall) with one glass all to myself and lick my lips at many other brews on the menu.  Add a wine list beyond belief and liquor if its your poison too.

The proximity to my own compound and the blossoming bud that is the central Phoenix renaissance  is always worth a gold star; why commute when staying local is a better option?

The staff and owners of the Sidebar are fantastic.  From my induction many months ago they sling the drinks with pride and the effort in the setup and delivery of the place doesn't go unnoticed. 

The decor is where things start to slide.  Not because the place is hovel, far from it.  Everything is crisp and new.  From the hydraulic bar stools, to the multicolored ambient lighting to the comfy lounge couches, to the super clean bathrooms; this place is a slice of upper crust for those of us who don't normally even thing to nibble from such a decadent pie.  Herein lies the problem or as my former boozing partner visiting from his new digs in Portland put it, ""I'd like to see this place with about 10 years worth of dust on it.""  Not my style, but I dig it and Phoenix sure as hell needs a place like it.

In the end I will go back and don't mind in the slightest having a place like Sidebar to show off to East Valley dwellers and Scottsdale brats, but every time I reach for the front door I pause and am sad.

A mere few feet away lies the corpse of the beloved Emerald Lounge.  A dark, seedy, dirty, smoke filled haven of locals, live music, art and personality that is now nothing but a painted over ghost.  So please, support your local bar, bring your friends and keep the sidebar real.  But remember to pause for a moment of silence and drink one to the ghost below your feet; us locals will thank you.",0
"Have you ever been to Postino for lunch?  I think of it as an after work spot, but the lunch is really good.  It's peaceful and pretty at Postino at lunchtime, the bruschetta is just as tasty during the day as it is in the evening, and the panini are good, too.",1
"I had lunch today at CASK 63 with a banker to discuss our collective power to create business in the Phoenix Market. I HAD THE ABSOLUTE BEST CRAB SALAD, I've had since leaving the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. Red Crab Salad....fresh, clean, sweet, crisp..light...in a very well appointed setting. Very  good iced teas as well....hard to find in Phoenix.....Go there...Eat there...you will like it..and we might see one another...who knows...be like nike..just do it...:)",1
"Sorely disappointed.  

I used to be a fan, but this barely half-full(at high noon on a Monday!) restaurant just doesn't cut it anymore. 

Wait staff was sub-par, food was average, and the prices still conveyed the idea that the management thought they were awesome.

Parking is a royal pain in the butt -- and has clearly had an effect on other nearby businesses.  (This part is no fault of Uno's as far as I know).

If given a choice for a tasty business lunch, look elsewhere.",2
"Okay, I have been to DryBar on multiple occassions and have been pleased once, maybe twice, but it wasn't horrible.  Unfortunately, the day of my wedding was horrible.  My fault that I didn't go in for a practice run, BUT I was assured by their ANSWERING SERVICE that I would get ""one of their best,"" because that's who they send out.  The lady that came to our hotel room to do our (my mom and me) hair was rude and not talented.  She barely spoke and when she did it was defensive and not from a place of yes.  When a bridesmaid (who went to DryBar to get her hair done and wasn't satisfied) agreed with me that my hair style should be fixed, the stylist looked at her phone and said,""well, what time is it?"" as she argued with us that she couldn't do anything else with my hair because it's fine.  We were like ""we don't care what time it is, it's my wedding, and I will pay you whatever it takes to get my hair looking the way I want it.""  My mom hated her hair, took pictures to send to DryBar and then fixed it herself.  The problem with getting a quick solution is that they have an answering service which makes problem solving an issue, especially when you have limited time and makes scheduling a large group complicated.  Again, I've been happy once or twice, they have a few good stylists and a lot of very mediocre ones.  I think I'll try some of the other blowdry bars in town.",2
This is a great boutique in North Scottsdale.  Ruby has such cute dresses to go out in and is a little jewel box inside of this shopping center.  As the two other reviews said they carry great brands like the established Tibi or even new brands.  One  that I saw and loved from Phoenix Fashion Week was Smoke & Mirrors Clothing from Los Angeles.  Ruby carries a lot of what I saw and loved on the runway.  Ruby is always getting new stuff in so it's a great place to check in with anytime you need a dress or a kick start to your newest fashion routine. Two thumbs up!,1
"Wow, Chill rocks. Frank and his lovely wife, the proprietors, are fantastic. The prices are super low and the gelato/sorbet is awesome. While we were there, a little kid dropped the top part of his cone on the ground. Frank replaced it for free. 

Then he gave us a sample of the fat-free, sugar-free chocolate sorbet, which made me want to buy a pint of it... after I had already eaten a baby sized Mango/Pomegranate mix. Yum. 

How about this: Go have dinner/lunch/breakfast/whatever at Pita Jungle, then walk across the parking lot to Chill for dessert. That sounds like the perfect evening.",1
"I finally tried out Valle Luna on Sunday.  I must say that the food is authentic and one of the better Mexican restaurants in the Valley.  The salsa and chips are homemade and simply tasty.  I had the fish tacos that were fried and came with cabbage and soft shells - delicious.

The waitress that served me was attentive.  I must say that the seating did take a while and I was one of two people in line, hence no five star here.  The portions were decent, the tacos could have had more fish in them.

Overall I am pleased with the restaurant and you will be too.",1
"Friendly staff and clean office.
From what I have seen, somewhat frequent turnover with the Dr.'s I've had.
Right now I have Dr. Susman, she's concise, to the point, compassionate, easy to understand.

Oral surgeon Dr. Lillien does his job well, I got my wisdom teeth out without complications or infections later.
Healed up pretty well.

Scheduled out pretty far so difficult to get an appointment in if you have specific avail abilities.

Certain staff could use more training on procedure and techniques to expedite the process and minimize x-ray radiation time.

Julie is doing a breast cancer walk, so donate (personal check) and get teeth whitening kit for 99 dollars.

About staff:

Kendall is very friendly and professional.
Noreen seems like she could use more training (quite a few x-ray retakes with bite tabs), but she was friendly overall.
The process took a bit longer than I anticipated.

Suggestions:
Train the staff thoroughly, with technique and procedure so it can speed up customer service. especially with bite tab as well as the other kind (the red circular one). Customers like to minimize their radiation exposure time : )

Clean office and helpful reception staff. Dr. Susman was to the point and very clear about wahts going on and what to do next.


downfall:
Scheduling can be somewhat difficult if ppl have specific avail abilities but in general, reception staff is very helpful",0
I highly reccomend this place. They helped my girlfriend and I figure out our taxes and deductions so that we could get the max refund. We both had been doing our taxes online and missing out on hundreds in deductions. Ill never use another online service to do my taxes again as long as these guys are here.,1
"It was my Birthday and my wife, her mom, a dear friend and I headed to Fleming's Steakhouse in Chandler, AZ. We heard only great things about this place and wanted to experience their 'unforgettable' steak dishes. That, we did, unfortunately. 

The restaurant was lovely dim-lit, adequate atmosphere for an expensive steak place. We were seated immediately and tended to by the waiting staff. The small roll of bread and two kinds of butter were good but insufficient for four hungry souls and we polished it up right away. No one offered to bring more. Our waiter told us about the daily specials, after which we ordered food and wine. After a short wait, four large dinner plates arrived. I was the lucky one, my steak (a large  rib eye steak, ordered medium-rare which tasted very good despite two large blobs of fat) was sitting pretty in the middle of the large dinner plate. Nothing else on my plate, just the steak. I looked around at my wife's plate and couldn't believe, her fillet mignon was laying there, in the middle of the large dinner plate without anything garnishing it, be that a glaze, a leaf, a slice of whatever! At the prices asked by this restaurant, it felt like an insult to each of us to have such a poor presentation of a steak!! We asked our waiter for a side dish, mashed potatoes with Parmesan, and when they arrived, we couldn't believe it! There were no more than two scraggly potatoes turned into mashed potatoes, or about a tablespoon of mashed potatoes per person. Mind you, they tasted good, but at over $9.00 per side dish? In short, we left hungry and wondering why we spent over $200 for the entire meal.

Next time, we'll go to a well tried place for steaks and more. Durant's, downtown Phoenix and worth the drive.",2
I have liked every sub I've had there with the exception of one. Pretty good odds!,1
"Ice Ice Baby...
Ice Ice Baby...

All right stop collaborate and listen;
Ice Now is here and it's got my attention 
Make some drinks - not warm but frosty;
And believe me when I say they are not costly
Will it ever melt? yo I don't know.
Give them a call and they'll show
To the extreme I yelp like a sandal;
Ice your drinks and get lit like a candle
... Ice ice baby

PS - not sure where the sandal line came in but writing a review in lyric form is a challenge!  This is the best I can do for now...

Need ice for an event?  Call Ice Now! They offer free delivery and their pricing is surprisingly cheap.

And good luck getting the Ice Ice Baby lyrics out of your head... (sorry)!",1
"Fair pricing and no upselling. These guys are good--but be warned, it's as busy as an angry beehive on Monday mornings!",0
"I had heard they were spiced just right but for me it was too salty of a burger.  It was also expensive considering a I had a burger, hot dog, fries and a shake.  Not a favorite but wouldn't mind coming again.",0
"I tried Rare Earth for the first time as a solo diner.  Often a good way to get the take on a new restaurant.  I sat at the bar which has surprisingly uncomfortable seating.  Really hard seats that cut me in the back of the knees.  The wine selection is nice.  Not big but two or three choices of each variety.
I ordered a glass of wine,  a small House salad and a pizza.  
The server behing the bar was ""professionally friendly""  
Then the wait began.  Fifteen minutes passed and I still had no salad.  I was able to get the servers attention and asked about my salad. She didn't check on the status of the salad but gave the excuse that several people had come in around the same time that I did.
Just about 3 minutes later both my salad and my pizza came out at the same time.  Very disappointing.  I wanted to eat my salad but I didn't want my pizza to go cold.  Note: This is extremely thin pizza...like a cracker crust...so it goes cold very quickly.
The server offered to send the pizza back to keep it hot but since it had fresh tomato on it, I didn't want the pizza to be ruined.
The house salad was fresh, good mushrooms and shaved pecorino cheese.  There were lots of red onions and the dressing, a house vinaigrette was very strong ""and vinegary"". For me the onion and vinegar were just overwhelming and I would not order that particular salad again.
The pizza had a good amount of toppings and held together pretty well, even considering how thin the crust is. 

I would like to try this restaurant again because there were several things on the menu that sounded really good.

4 stars for the pizza, 2 stars for the salad that I ordered and 3 stars for the service.",0
"I've often driven by here, & figured I'd go in & take a look sometime. 
But I was looking for a clock-mini-speaker system that I use with my iPhone 4.  

When I had my 3G, I had a very bad experience where I was assured that a particular clock-mini-speakers I bought would work with it - but all it had was a cheap plastic adapter that the 3G kept falling out of - & then they gave me a hard time about a refund.

This time, I was again getting either glib reassurances & non-specific information, ""sorry out of stock""s, or  NO OPEN floor samples I could look at, at 3 other stores (including the big A Store with a lot of Jobs), not to mention conflicting info on Amazon & upon Googling.  

So I thought to go into the iStore. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! They had open, plugged in items that I could actually test my iPhone 4 in to make sure it worked. Even better, I began chatting with the guys there about various other iPhone &  MacBook Pro issues, & found they had FAR more knowledge about BOTH the phone & it's peripherals and MacBook Pro's (and HONESTY about them) than I ever got from the ""really-really-smart"" folks at the Big-A-Store-with-Jobs who will promise you anything. 

So, I would definitely go back there for honest advice & I would certainly bring in anything that needed warranty service.  They also have a pretty nice selection of peripherals and better yet, they know WHAT WORKS WITH WHAT!",1
"I noticed the sign for Shakey Jake's before it even opened. I waited paitiently for it to wait... I love barbeque! :) When it finally opened, my mom and I tried to get some grub there when we walked up, the cutest little boy came out of the resturant and told us they were close and would be open again tomorrow. We left disappointed but still wanted to give Jake's a try.

Over a month later, we finally did get a chance to do just that.

We entered Shakey Jakes and saw a nice, new & clean place. There was a large counter, and several red t-shirt wearing workers dishing up what looked & smelled like yummy barbeque. We waited in line and were handed menus. The walkways were narrow and left a small amount of space to sit. We were feeling the scrunch! We then sat down with our menus and chose our meals.

I went back to the register & was disappointed in the fact that they didn't have any more MacNCheese and there was some miscommunication when it came to my mom's order. I thought it came with Fries... and it didn't, it comes with a side dish. My mom wanted Cole Slaw AND fries... instead I accidentily ordred JUST cole slaw... but they charged me an extra fee for the cole slaw... so really, I just got screwed out of a side dish and it was pretty much downhill from there.

I didn't see the lil baskets of utensils and lids and straws on top of the very tall deli case. I had to take our recipt and the cups and I pourd our drinks and sat down. The TVs were SO damned loud we were shouting at eachother. I wanted to scream ""can you PLEASE turn that down?!"" My mom had to use the rest room and I told her she needed a key, which I learned from a previous review.

Anyway, finally our food came and our order number was called and I got up thinking I had to bring it to the table, when their server told me to sit down and that she'd bring it to us... ummm... okay? but as she did, she told us that the utensils were by the register. WTF?! ARGHHH!! I was JUST there!! It was ackward, uncomfortable, annoying and frustrating.

So i got up AGAIN, if I could have just picked up my own order, I could have also gotten my utensils in one big graceful swoop. I THINK the owners need to give out those lil numbers for their tables, think Carl's Jr. So there's no more confusion. AND give out those lil bags with utensils, napkin, salt & pepper packets. Because I'm 5'6"" and I had to get on my TIPPY Toes to see what the hell was in those baskets! Also, I ordered two medium sodas, and none of their lids fit. They were TOO small or TOO large!

The cashier was really nice, but the smaller things made this place intolerable. I couldn't walk to our table without hitting EACH and every single table and chair... ugh, that's the last thing I need. a reminder that maybe having yet another meal out is the LAST thing I should be subjecting my body to.

I sat down and looked at my plate, the fuck?! I ordered pork ribs, and they gave me beef. I looked at the recipt and it said... beef. *harsh sigh* lucky for them, they both cost the same! I remembered reading their sign underneith the cashier that said they'd be happy to help you out if there's anything wrong with your order IF the food was untouched and IF you still had your recipt. sooooo... because the cashier hit beef instead of pork and I paid - I was screwed.

Choosing to just go with it, I opened up my side dishes and the yams were good. nothing great, but still good. The cole slaw was way too sweet for me. The corn bread was good!! The highlight of the meal! their cornbread is better than LoLo's! There I said it! I just wish Shakey Jake's would make theirs bigger. The ribs were VERY good, they had a serious smoke ring and the sauce had a nice bite to it. My mom didn't care for her sandwich, she said there wasn't enough sauce and that the meat was very fatty. She liked the yams and the coleslaw. We both agreed that the peach cobbler was YUMMY! I just wish they baked it longer.

When we left, I was full and not as aggravated like I was before. I do want to give Shakey Jake's another chance (maybe without my mom). To my yelpers, if you go - be sure the check your recipt, get your utensils right after you order & expect a server to bring your food when it's done.",0
"I have tried the other one on shea, but this is close to home and work. I love the enviornment, the clientle, the healthy food, outstanding service and very reasonable prices. The waitstaff is great, the food always comes out quick and tastes amazing. Get anything with chicken as it is delicious and if you like hummus try it here. Also, they have great ice tea. This place is one of my favorites and well worth a try.",1
"Ok, so this is a Sprouts now. Boring.
The layout of the store is pretty much the same as when it was Sunflower. I would like this Sprouts more, if it was like an actual Sprouts. Instead it's just a weird transitiony in between ""Sproutsflower"". That's what I'm calling it, until they figure it out. Atleast they still have the soup bar.",0
Cheap and delicious!  Can't beat that.,1
"Slow service, staff needs more training. There's like 4 managers and none of the know what they are doing, i don't think this place is going to make it. Sorry but you lost 4 very good patrons Saturday night because of your poor customer service",2
"Some hits and some misses.

Hits : bruschetta and salads

Misses: Pizzas other then the margherita (luckily though I got the scrumptious tomato and mozzarella pizza)

Great service and pretty good food.",1
Yum!  The toasted barley app is delicious. My boyfriend and I shared the eggplant sandwich and the monk burger. Both of the sandwiches were outstanding. The service was great too. We will definitely go back.,1
"How many great things can one say about the Cartel? Does Infinity work! Yes, that was a statement, not a question. I am in love with the CC, hands down. I have traded my gold Starbucks card in for this amazingly Delicious start to my day. The iced coffee ( actually, its Toddy, which is better) is amazing. They roast their own beans, and allow the iced coffee to sit over night, creating an extremely potent concoction. The hot drinks, A+++ as well. And, the food? A+++++ (5, yup its that legit). Grab the cheddar bacon muffin... its literally heaven. No joke. Heaven. Little clouds may form above your head; white clouds of course! Not those nasty rain clouds. OK, maybe not clouds. But defiantly your day will be sunny because you stopped into Coffee Cartel. And not because you live in AZ. Duh. 

Only complaint I have is the hours. I live right next door, and their only open M-F (like so many places in DT-Pho). 

PLLLEEEEAAAASSSEEEEEE open up for the weekends!!! I'll work for free! Well...wait... I'll come visit.",1
"We went to dinner there on a Sunday and we were the only ones in there for most of our dinner. Downtown Phoenix can be somewhat quiet on the weekends, so this was no surprise. The service was great as was the food. I had a pizza and if you like thin, crispy crust you will enjoy the pizza as well. The music was a little loud for a Sunday dinner, especially since we were pretty much the only ones in the restaurant. I will go again, probably during the week so I can get a taste of what it is like when it is busy!! Overall...decent meal!",0
"I used to work here so it had to be good;) Honestly, I would say it is the most friendly place I had been to. Cashiers are willing to except all coupons and work with their customers. The prices are great and the gas rewards system is very useful. I just wish it was a Marketplace instead.",1
"Came for a friend's birthday and really was not that impressed. First of all, it took us a while to find parking as this place only has street parking and a few spots in back. On Saturday if you are there before 7pm, all alcohol was 1/2 off and some appetizers were on special. We ate dinner there and the menu was very limited. The food was okay, but our burgers were over cooked. The service was slow and it took us a while to get our check. I'd go to hang out again and have a few drinks, but I wouldn't suggest making this your regular hang out.",0
"Tailgating here is something else altogether, but if you are doing ANYTHING near ASU, then you already know about the party scene. Let us get to the stadium proper... 

This place is huge. Standing down on the field and looking up towards that blue Arizona sky will give you a little perspective on just how massive this place is. Sandwiched between two mountains, it's easy to get lost in your surroundings. 

The only bone I have to pick is with the fact the bathrooms are like finding water in the desert. I was expecting a stadium of this size to have numerous bathrooms, but I had to do more then a little searching to locate one. 

If you are looking to catch a college football game and get the ""big stadium"" experience, Sun Devil Stadium is a pretty good place to start.",0
"I feel bad for this park. Its nice. Really nice. The only problem is its in Phoenix where it is hot like heck. That means the roof is always closed. And with the roof closed, it almost feels like you are watching baseball inside of an auditorium.",0
"Decent wash, generally pretty quick. Used to be Octopus Car Wash. Has lube and detail center, although I have never used that service. 

One of the better wash places- way better than Danny's for sure..",1
"I liked this place. Great Atmosphere and music. Their Guacamole and Salsa is really good. Service was good too, My server (forgot his name) came by often to check on me (Or because he thought I was gonna run out on the bill) and was really nice. I had the Carne flatbread, surprisingly good! Id definitely come back when I have have the money

Good place for a date as well!",1
Wasn't impressed. Dressing tasted like a store bought bottle dressing and tomatoes very very mushy.,2
"This place is as good as it gets for shooting.   I became a full member today after also researching Shooter's World, Phoenix Rod & Gun, and Scottsdale Gun Club (where I will also become a member).   The cost is VERY reasonable at $85/year ($110 after adding the initial administrative fee).

The club is huge (140 acres).   There is a main range for members and the public.  Then, there are multiple other shooting areas for members only.   You can shoot out to 500 yards at this facility AND you can shoot any weapon.   The only restrictions appear to be on the allowable ammo.  

I'm really looking forward to shooting at this club next weekend.",1
"this was our first breakfast hit-up since we moved back, and gotta say it again....the protein pancakes are still da bomb. so lucious, cruchy yet soft, sweet yet salty, healthy but so much syrup...mmmm! go at an off time or you'll be knocking elbows with the elderly.",1
"I am always on the prowl for a good burger so when I heard there was a new burger place in Tempe I knew I had to try it out.

The boyfriend and I went to Lobby's on a Friday night. It was not busy but the location doesn't really lend itself to busy. So we were able to walk right in and order. It's an order at the counter and grab a seat kinda place. We both ordered cheeseburgers and got an order of fries to share. I liked that the burgers were not pre-made frozen patties. They threw down two hunks of beef on the grill.

The burgers were tasty, a nice size - not too big, not too small - and the fixin's were fresh. So was the bun. 
The fries were crinkle cut but they were crispy and good.

The atmosphere was fine, good for a quick sit-down and the staff was friendly.

I hope they can survive in this location because they are worth a repeat visit for sure.",1
"Ok so the look of the portions in the pictures are very deceptive.  The waffle and pancakes arent big as they look, however I am stuffed so I guess the waffle was big enough.  the food was very good, I thought it would be better, but I am not disappointed.  I would come back here :) the waffle was not as good as the farm and the pancakes were not as good as first watch. but thats just my opinion.  Next time I want to try some of their scrambles.",0
"Jack in the Box, this one in particular, is busiest from 10pm-2am. It definitely a ""better when your drunk"" kind of place, or at least I think it is from the number of drunk patrons I see eating there. 

The food? Well, it's JitB, what do you expect? You got the 99 cent for 2 tacos deal, which is a must add for any meal. You also have breakfast served all day. This means you can get a Extreme Sausage Sandwhich, 2 Tacos, and a Chicken Fajita Pita in the same meal. That's some good eatin'. Please note that nothing about the Chicken Fajita Pita is remotely close to an actual fajita. 

This location specializes in making your food NOT look like it does in the picture. The picture may show a big fluffy bun with a juicy burger, however your burger will probably look like someone stepped on it then ran it over with their car. It doesn't change the taste, tho. Still tastes exactly like you would expect something to taste from JitB. I mean, it's good food and a good value. By ""good"" food, I of course mean greasy and unhealthy. That is the definition of good food though, right?",0
"I went here to try a  new salon and they were very rude when i first walked in like, I was wasting there time, I just wanted to know about there tanning prices and they kept trying to up sell me on there other products even though i kept telling them no thank you, finally when i got a tanning bed they asked how long i wanted to go for, i said the full  time and the lady tells me i should do less time because I'm a red head, I told her that i have been tanning for years now that I'm fine with the full time, she still gave me a hard time saying i should do less, finally i was like whatever and did less time. The only reason I give them two stars is because there beds are really nice and i got good color from them, but it was not worth the hassle for me to want to go back.",2
"Really great food and service, and it worked out just fine for my two kids, ages 7 and 10. (Meatball pizza was a hit for the younger one; the older one shared sausage pizza and mussels.) The food came very quickly. We had all small plates and pizza, not entrees: kale chips, fried chickpeas, peppers, mozzarella salad. Dessert was great. The mousse was first rate, and the parsnip creme brulée was delicious (though we couldn't taste any parsnip; it just tasted like excellent, flavorful creme brulée). One of the best meals we had in Arizona. And we also really liked the decor. Simple, elegant, and also fun/creative. Not sure why anyone would ding them for that. Also, the portion sizes were just fine. We all left full but not feeling gross. We're from MA, and were unaware of the chef's celebrity. I wonder if some of the griping here is just celebrity bashing, or a reaction against some sort of hype? I'm outside that loop, but it just struck us as an excellent and fun place with great food and no pretension. Just thorough competence. Note: It's a nice walk from the Arizona Biltmore Hotel. Under 2 miles.",1
"Perhaps it was foolish for me to give La Condesa only four stars at first, given the fact that I really liked it.  What can I say?  I'm critical by nature.  I knew I was going back soon, so I felt like I had to save the last for a return visit.  Well, it just got it.

This place is fantastic.  In fact, if CenPho lets this one go under, I will personally hold all of you responsible; watch out for a citizen's arrest if I ever see you.  However, that is unlikely to happen, because the food is damn tasty.  

Today, the Oaxaca black mole chicken taco had me swooning, topped with pickled onions; the chicken is tender and simmered in the lovely sauce.  The Soronan carne asada taco, char-grilled over mesquite charcoal is no slouch either; I'd rate it right up there with some of my favorites in town.  

Go to this place; I have a feeling I'll be here at least weekly.  When and if they ever get a beer/liquor license...probably more.",1
"Scottsdale Fashion Square is the king of shopping centers in Arizona. It's unrivaled and it maintains it's crown through constant improvements, expansions, and new stores. Empty stores are rare. Try that on for size, PV mall. 


The food court is decent, but a wide variety of restaurants surround the mall, providing the shopper with an endless amount of stores, and a great selection of places to eat. Scottsdale Fashion Square aims to please the most critical, and goes above and beyond all expectations.",1
The employees here are really nice and I like the island feel. The food is pretty good and I like it because there aren't many other places in town with Hawaiian food. I also like that you can get beer here.,0
"I have mixed feeling about the W Scottsdale. During the day the pool area is poorly run, but in the evenings the pool turns into a pretty fun nightlife spot.  

Daytime:
The pool is always jam packed with a fairly disgusting crowd and the dudes out number the babes by a 3 to 1 count I'd say. That's no fun. Oh, and by dudes, I mean douche bags. And Babes? More like gross skanks covered in makeup at the pool. Ok, I guess I'm being a hater, but spend a few hours here and you might be kind of disgusted with the scene too. It's just really amateur hour here with the piss poor service and their bad attitudes and obnoxious patrons. The only reason I came was because a friend likes to stay at the W when visiting and he too noted the quality of this place has declined over the years. He has stayed at four different W locations (NY, South Beach, Westwood) and said this one is the ""worst and trashiest"". It took an hour before any waitress came over to ask if we wanted any drinks or food. When started to get service it was always a long wait for our pitcher of margaritas or buckets of beer and food. Speaking of the food, the fries, fish tacos and club sandwich are all great. The grilled cheese, not so much. The first $42 pitcher of margaritas was weak, hardly tasting any alcohol. The second pitcher was stronger. To be fair, the Saturday service was much better.

Nighttime:
Much improved scene, but still not great. There are a lot of out-of-towners since it is a hotel, but still plenty of locals too. I think it's a good mixture. Pants and collared shirts are required, so that usually gets rid of most of the tank top, neck tat wannabes from earlier in the day at the pool.  But really, you are just trading one group of wannabes for another. Man, I'm a hater huh? Oh well, you can handle it. Drinks are overpriced, but this is the W. Be ready to spend lots o' cash.

Rooms:
I've been in a few rooms at this hotel. Each have been nice and clean, but pretty small.",2
"The three of us ate at Famous Dave's last evening and had a really nice time! 

We stopped in around 5:30 or so and were seated at a booth in the bar area. It was still early, so there was plenty of seating throughout the restaurant. Our server came by a few moments after we were seated and asked about our drink order. Nice. 

If you have never been to a Famous Dave's, it's sort of like a Texas Roadhouse, which is a complement. I've had some really good BBQ over the years in local Roadhouses throughout the US, and clearly this chain has copied the model. 

We started with some onion strings and chicken tenders off the Happy Hour menu along with our drinks. Both were good, but ordinary. What made them good was Dave's sauce. At each table you have five or six choices, as well as the sauce that came from the kitchen. 

For dinner we order a Pulled-Pork sandwich with sides, a large BBQ Huli platter and some Texas steak tips grande nachos. Each was delicious and large enough that we couldn't finish. One observation on portions, they are large -- like two Styrofoam take home boxes large 

For dessert we order some $1.98 mini puddings and brownies. Just the right size for everyone after a large dinner. 

Fellow Yelper Scott D put it best in his 7/23/10 review: ""Famous Dave's consistently delivers no matter which location you go to"". Our party of three heartily agrees! 

The tab came to $69.49, including taxes but without tip. We thought that was fair given the serving size and the tastiness of the food. We will be back! 

Enjoy!",1
"C'mon! Fresh sandwich lunch for $3? The place makes it to order, incredible variety of baguette style sandwiches. Cash only, but the have an ATM in the lobby with a low fee. Or is it no fee? Anyway, great coffee and drinks and teas. Line moves super fast. Number pickup system is funky. My family packs these things to take home on the plane!",1
"I have been going to Physical Therapy for several weeks working on Plantar Faciatis (ripped tendons in the foot), I was not getting enough massage to make much progress, I switched to Massage N You and they focused on my calves and now we are making good progress on healing.

"Husband and I have been trying to go to Urban Cookies for a while now. For one reason or another we kept missing its store hours. We finally made it today, and boy, were we glad. 

I had a vanilla cupcake and he had the urban cookie, which has chocolate chips and walnuts. The cookie was the perfect balance of moist and crispy. 

The guy behind the counter told us that the vanilla cupcakes was a special, but when they rotated it out people yelled at them. After taking one bite, I totally understood why. The cupcake is the best I've ever had. The vanilla frosting is not too sweet, perfectly creamy and melts in your mouth. 

I just hope they get more business so they can expand their hours!",1
"i too came because of a living social deal, as it turned out it really didn't save us any money. 

the buffet is odd. lots of different kinds of food. onion rings, fries, chicken nuggets with baked cheese eggplant, stuffed grape leaves, hummus. i sampled a bit of everything.

i liked the soup, very nice, i couldn't identify the spice, i don't know anything about mediterranean food. but i know what i like. i like 3 different olive dominated dishes, i wish i could cook eggplant that kept it shape this well. i liked the hot pita bread. i loved salad with big chucks of feta cheese. there where several tasty chicken dishes that were excellently seasoned with big chucks of flavorful chicken.

the american staples, probably for the kids and unadventuresome guests was bland and a bit dry, expected for a buffet, where the food sits out under lights.

advice:
group the foods by origin, not by meat, vegies, salad.
make up a route down one side of the serving table, greek, turkish, Lebanese. 
make it a learning experience, tell us which dishes use olives, what kinds of spices.

if you want people to come back teach them a little bit about the food, share the culture, don't mix chickem mcnuggets with a tasty pulled chicken dish just because they both have chicken in them. tell me why this is good food, help me learn something the cook knows about his homeland.

so i walk down one side and get a greek-turkish meal. the other side is another culture, then one side for the bland american food. as is everything was mixed up.

now, i'm going back again. with my laptop and a notepad, and hungry. i'm going to taste each dish by label- if i don't know what it is, i'm going to sit down and google it. i'm going to learn where it's from and what spices are in it. i'm going to make my own learning experience. if the owners sit down with me and explain how their food expresses their culture, i'll rate it 5 stars next time.

it's a family business, it's a huge building, it has a good talented cook(s) somewhere in the kitchen, it is good tasting food. it needs to be displayed and presented differently. it wasn't busy, a shame, industrialized food is always bland and busy.

now, if you grew up with these dishes, you can leave a review about their tastiness and authenticity. that would help.",0
"i love trader joe's!!! 

i think they're selection of products are just GREAT!!! i can't get enough of it.

the place is clean and the people are friendly. it's right next to michaels which is also great. it's in a convenient place. it seems like the people there are nutty-crunchy which i love!!",1
"What a load of absolutely hideous, uninteresting crap.

Take every single one-star review written by Yelpers below, copypaste them here and you will have a far more eloquent summary of my feelings on this place than anything I can come up with.

I have no reason to ever come here. Certainly not free will. The one time I did come here I was forced to by a friend who was meeting another friend.",2
"It isn't often enough that I get to dine at Carlsbad, but last night I decided to have dinner there. I'll be completely honest, service is always a mixed bag. But then you figure when they're crammed to the gills (which is generally how it goes), you can't always expect Speedy freaking Gonzales to be your server. However, last night I don't think I could have sneezed between the time I ordered my food and when it arrived to my table. Excellent.. is all I can say about this joint.

If you're looking for some tasty New Mexican fare, get over there!! And if it's packed, let the valet park your car(CUZ ITS FREE)! Start off with a Dos Equis Amber, get some nachos(this vegetarian WILL eat the niblets of chicken in them nachos cuz it's just that tasty) and kick back. Preferably on the patio...because there's a waterfall!!! 

And if Jacob's working the bar.. expect nothing but the best in cocktails... seriously.",1
"Finally Biltmore gets a sushi place after the departure of Ayako! Well if you have been to Stingray in Old Town Scottsdale, this is same menu, etc. But I happened to like the atmosphere at this location better!
Came here for a happy hour, had a drink called the Tokyo Tease(delish!) and since I love sashimi sushi (which isn`t on the happy hour menu, no big deal), ordered my sashimi combo, which didn`t disappoint!! Included tuna, salmon and yellowtail. Did enjoy the bevy of assorted rolls that went by. I like the outside/inside seating bar- great on beautiful weather days! I will be back for more!!",1
"Excellent service.  Easy to access.  Dessert is amazing.  Husband loved Salted Butter gelato, I loved the cherry.  he always loves his fish entrees here.  I eat very unsophisticated so finding anything here on the menu is hard for me.  I tried a pasta last night, it was salty and boring.  
I still recommend this place for people with grown up tastes.",1
Stop here every time I'm in town!,1
"FAN-FREAKIN' -TASTIC!

Yes, it's a Great steakhouse... but they also have a Great wine selection... and Great bread to start... and Great desserts.... and Great service.

Rich and Richie took exceptional care of us.  They were attentive and fun to talk to... too.

I had the Prime Rib and it was huge and perfectly prepared. I ended up taking the rest home and having it for lunch the next day and it was just as good the following day.  :)

The Bread to start came with 2 different flavored butters.  You could easily fill up on bread before dinner.... so go easy on this as they will keep bringing out refills if you let them.

The Dessert.... we got the Chocolate Lava Cake... and the cake part was good... but the sides that came with the cake... they were Amazing.  The Chantilly Cream they serve on the side of the cake is freshly made and it's a Little Pillow of Heaven.  Rich brought us more when we ate all the cream and still had cake left.  And then they have a little homemade pistachio cookie with vanilla ice cream on the side too... these were great too... So, net, net... I wouldn't order the Chocolate Lava Cake for the cake part.... I'd order it for the things that come WITH the cake.  :)

Good for special occassions and if you are looking to have a lovely evening out.",1
"Was in town for a business meeting and tried to catch a movie with a friend. First impression of the place was that it needed a total make over.  I mean TOTAL MAKEOVER. Walked up to buy my ticket, and the lady was a total jerk! She had no idea when the movie times were, and she clearly thought we were stupid. She messed up our change, and didn't believe us when we told her. When we walked in they ripped the tickets out of our hands.  When it came time to order our food, the butter on the popcorn tasted like cough syrup. The theater was extremely dirty, and kids were screaming throughout the movie.  After the movie I politely told the manager about our horrible experience.  He was not understanding at all and even threatened to kick us out. I was appaled by this whole endeavor and that is why I am writing this review. It was a complete waste of time and money and I recommend everyone to stay away.",2
"The bad: the bar closes at 10pm.  It seems like the western, country, wagon-wheel themed bar that you'd like to close down one night while playing some good tunes on the juke box and eating peanuts.  And also the french fries, file those under bad.

The good: the hamburgers are pretty much delicious.  Definitely go for guacamole, and add whatever you want from the topping wagon.

I didn't try one myself, but I hear the cookies are good.",1
"Last week, I had my first appointment at Pure Dental. Dr. Kang and the office staff were all really nice and helpful. Dr. Kang even did my cleaning and it was very thorough. I've never had the actual dentist give me my cleaning. I was wowed by their modern equipment to view x-rays and the doctor even took pictures of my teeth to show me. I will be going back to get some filings next week and was told I could watch a movie while I was getting them done.",1
"I am not happy with the co worker who introduced me to Forefathers.  Do I really need another way to feed my addiction to cheesy, beefy goodness?  

Of course I do!

This small restaurant in a Tempe strip mall has earned a special place in my heart.  No, not just because of the artery-strengthening cheese.  It is home to the best cheesesteak I have experienced since moving to AZ.

While the menu offers a variety of choices other than cheesesteak sandwiches (chicken and even *gasp!* salads), I stick with what I know and love:

Regular with Cheez Wiz ($7.35) - bring your appetite, because this sandwich is big!  A generous portion of thinly sliced meat and that oh so important Cheez Wiz is nestled within a soft bun.  It is gooey, drippy and messy.  Perfect.  If Wiz is not for you, it is also offered with white American cheese, Provolone or Mozzarella.  While I prefer mine with just the basic meat and cheese, you healthy types can also get any combination of 'OMG' - onions, mushrooms and green peppers.

Fries are a very nice compliment to the sandwich.  Let's be honest here, fries are a very nice compliment to nearly anything.  Forefathers' fries ($2.55) are hot, salty and crisp.  If you haven't gotten your fill of Wiz on your sandwich, you can turn those fries into Cheese Fries ($2.95).  Either way, be sure to grab a container of 'fry sauce' (I am guessing this is some blend of ketchup and mayo).  One taste and you will want to put this on everything.  

Lucky for me and my cholesterol level, this gem is nowhere near where I live.",1
"Almost as good as the original Boomers.  Wasn't quite there for me but maybe because I was there on a Sunday and the help clearly wasn't into working that day.  Can't say I blame them though.

Anyways, same good menu selections, good prices.  Sliders were tasty but not as good as at the original Boomers.    

Needless to say, I'll be back and try them again.  These guys have awesome Chicago dogs and it would be a shame not to try them here!",1
"Love love love this place.  Tasty with great prices... who can beat that?  My newest thing is to order a gyro-to-go and enjoy it at home.  I'm a mom now so eating at a restaurant is a lot harder than it used to be. haha

See ya there!",1
"Went on a recommendation from my brother...I owe him a beer or something!  Great, great food.  The bbq is the best I've had anywhere, hands down.  The prices are great.  

We tried all of their sides while there (Group of 5, and you get 2 sides with each meal, so we did it on purpose).  The potato salad was pretty disappointing, and is the only thing holding me back from 5 stars.  The rest were delicious.  DO not miss out on the BBQ beans or the mac & cheese (I know, ""mac and cheese--really?"") YES.  Little bits of their smoked bacon mixed in makes it so, so good. Sweet potato fries were really, really good as well. I did not try the waffle fries, but my husband liked them & he is a waffle fry snob.

Had the pulled pork, spicy sausage, beef brisket, ribs...all of it delicious.  They have a wide variety of sauces you get to pick out & add yourself, or just eat the meat straight up.

My 12 year old daughter said that ""the food tastes like the air smells when you go camping"" (she was referring to that delicious smokey flavor...it was cute to me).

The place is small, but I don't blame them for that--you have to be able to establish yourself in this economy or you'll go under.  Hopefully they will be able to expand someday.  Driving out from Mesa won't be easy!!",1
"I met a friend for lunch yesterday. 

Loved the water feature and patio walking in, if it had been warmer I would have definitely sat outside. 

Inside was a little dark and I guess it was all the bats around but it reminded me of ""Dusk Till Dawn"". 

We were seated, I hope was hoping for chips and salsa, I guess they don't serve them here? 
We weren't even offered the ones on the menu, which I probably would have declined anyway because chips and salsa should be complimentary. 

Anyhow I ordered the Fresh Snapper Tacos (see pics) 
There is a lot of fish there being smothered by all those peppers, but as for everything else what you see is what you get.

For $15 I would have liked more than a TBSP of each, rice and beans, and a DEFINITELY more than a teaspoon of cheese and sour cream and maybe a lime or lemon. 
There was more garnish on the plate than anything. Other than that it was good. 

My Friend ordered the Green Chile Stew and The Green Chile Mac and Cheese (see pics) She has been here before so knew what she liked. I tasted the macaroni and thought it was pretty good too.

I'll give 3 stars until I go back and try out some other things.",0
"Despite not being Federal employees in any way, Memorial Day seems to be a time when restaurateurs think they deserve a day off, leaving me with few actual lunch options and relegating me to the worst of the worst: Eating. In an AIRPORT RESTAURANT.

Turns out that Taberna wasn't actually as bad as all that - the bar is nice to spend a few hours waiting for your flight, and the titular Blue Burrito - despite not being blue in any way, shape or form - wasn't too bad by fast food standards, and quite plentiful for the $8 I spent on it. And if you don't like it, you can cover it with Cholula, close your eyes, and pretend you're eating somewhere better.",2
"burger heaven! I had THE PIG Burger... it. was. delicious.  and it was served on a pretzel roll.  mmmmmm

Good vibe feeling in Circle H, I like the pictures on the walls, the bar look, the entire environment was relaxed and easy going.  I came the day of the official ribbon cutting, so I got to see that happen (i had no idea those giant gold scissors were real scissors by the way.  i guess, that is a dumb though b/c what else would they be??) and it was nice to see everyone gathered for this moment.

The french fires were piping hot and delicious, they have all sorts of sides like slaw, beans, mac n cheese etc.  

I also had a bite of the brisket sandwich.  It was so very very good, I am ordering that next time I go back.  

Local beers on tap, good price too.

Great start for a new restaurant, there were of course the new hickups, but those kins get worked out with more time. Nothing to worry about.  That's how you learn!!",1
"I think Fate is delicious and great! I love the remodeled house the restaurant is in....super cute! Fate's crab puffs are simply amazing,filled with cream cheese and crab goodness!  The hong kong flat rice noodles are scrumptious! The sauce on the flat rice noodles is SO flavorful, I could  eat them all day! I don't get all of the bad reviews on Fate. I think those people are simply crazy!",1
"I was a little hesitant of Zipps when we pulled in - didn't look from the outside like it would offer an awesome time.  Walking in around 7 on a Friday night revealed a place that was almost full.  We chose to sit on the chilly patio, which did have a couple of heaters.  The heaters were a little high up and less effective, but it was also one of the coldest nights this year. 

Service was fast and friendly, we never ran out of beer.  I got the BLT on Sourdough, and so did my friend, her husband got the Black and Blue Burger.  The fries were good, but not as crispy as I like.  The flavor was great and I ended up eating all of them.  The BLT was awesome! Tons of crispy bacon, and they cut it so that you were able to eat the sandwich without bacon attacking you.  The sourdough bread was thick cut and lightly toasted.

The burger was a little less than we expected - 2 nice size patties, but the blue cheese could have been done a little better, and it was very messy.  The onion rings were nice sized and with great, fluffy breading on them.

The on tap beer list was a little heavy on the cheap domestics for my taste, but they did have an Alaskan Amber that went great with the food.

We were able to sit and talk for several hours, and the server made sure that we always had what we needed.",1
"I'd love to give these guys a better review, because they were very friendly and professional.  However, I was very dissapointed with the service I received.  I'll type the one sarcastic comment that I can't get out of my head and then I'll get to the more substantial feedback.  I thought a detail was supposed to be a little more DETAILED.

Here are the positives, because I want to give credit where credit is due.  The guys come to you and are very polite.  They were a little delayed, but called to let me know which I appreciated.  Also, they do a great job at steam cleaning the carpets and the exterior wax job was awesome.

On to the negatives.  When I came out to see the work they did, I immediately noticed several smudges in the interior which they cleaned after I pointed them out.  Also, I noticed a scratch on the passenger side leather seat and a hole punched in the carpet near the pedals.  Anyone who knows me knows that I am a DETAIL oriented person.  Those defects were not present in my car prior to this job.  To add to this bit of a let-down, a day later my boyfriend and I noticed that they didn't even touch my trunk!  They didn't even bother to vacuum it out!

When you advertise on your website ""showroom quality,"" I expect showroom quality.  Overall review: good job on the exterior, attention to detail in the interior was very poor.  I am really dissapointed that the attention to detail just wasn't there.  I was expecting so much more from a detail job.",2
"I stopped in here at 6:45am one morning and was told I was a bit early.  I'm used to coffee shops opening earlier I guess, but they were nice about it and invited me in to sit and wait. 

I liked their stacks of Latin American Vogue, and the artwork on the walls was nice.  They also had ice water out for you to serve yourself. 

I ordered my usual americano, and was pleased.  They have raw sugar you can serve yourself by the heaping spoonful out of a pretty candy dish.  That was lovely.

Also, they are now the only place to carry Sweet Peas Bakery items.  My favorite thing to do was walk down to Danielle's shop downtown and pick up some coffee at Royal and some of her Rosemary Shortbread cookies.  It doesn't sound yummy, but believe me they are!  Be sure to ask for some. 

At the time I went, the place was obviously not crowded and I received attentive service...",0
"Me and three girlfriends headed to La Bocca for Happy Hour after reading all the wonderful Yelp reviews. I was really excited on my way there, but left feeling underwhelemd. 

For me, it felt a little big, commercial, the decor was kinda cheesy - think red leather chairs, Pier1 Important wall sconces, even a ""VIP"" looking lounge in red velour. Hardly, original or intimiate enough to be considered an authentic ""wine bar"" in my opinion. If you're a regular at chain restaurants you'll probably think this is a cute place (call me a snob, whatever). Let's talk about the wine list at this ""wine bar"" --- it was okay but they were out of our first two choices of red - not ideal for a wine bar. Then, we ordered our bruchetta for our table of four and were annoyed when it came out cut in halves. Knowing we were sharing the plate, maybe the waitress should have clued us in? We ended up ordering a second board for the table so we could each try the variety. I do have to say, the bruchetta was good. 

We were clearly there for happy hour on a Wednesday night (which I do love goes until 6:30pm) but found it a little rude that the waitress came by six minutes after the mark to ask if we wanted a second round. There was no grace period so we paid full price. We did notice, that our full price glasses of wine were filled to the brim - so maybe 1/2 price = have the wine? 

Don't get me wrong... the place is cute enough, would def seem like a ""fancy date night place"" if I were still in college. I'd go again with girlfriends but won't be racing back with my husband. 

I wish we would have tried more food because that seems to be the key to this place. Ambiance and service are good - not great. Oh, and the music could use some updating. The playlist was... eh... interesting 

Maybe it's my love of Postino or maybe its because I was on Mill Avenue I was instantly judging the place.",0
"I have had the opportunity to watch games at the Staples Center, and Honda Center in Los Angeles and Anaheim. Both are great arenas and are very fan friendly. Jobing.com is totally different, and that's not a bad thing! I really enjoy the arena is in the same complex with restaurants and movie theater. Great place to hang out before and after the game. Parking is great, I actually had a parking pass and did not use it. I just parked at the west gate parking lot. The arena was very easy to acess, and we had a great time. We will be coming back many more times.",1
"FOOD: I tried the T-Rex (meat lovers pizza), and it was scrumptious. The Thai Peanut Sauce Pizza was a little weird, yet still tasty in its own way, and I could only handle one slice before growing tired of peanut sauce.  The Buffalo Chicken Wing Pizza was also pretty good. The highlight of the menu was the beer. The Elsie's Irish Cream, a milk stout, was one of the best stouts I've had (better than the Left Hand Stout). It had a strong coffee flavor but in a good way (I don't drink coffee). The Orange Blossom (mandarin orange hefeweizen) was the best Hefeweizen I've ever had, and I generally don't like Hefeweizens. The orange flavor definitely made that drink more than tolerable. I tried several other beers from Papago's own brewery, and the rest seemed  good. They have dozens of bottled beers in the fridges along the walls. But I never got a chance to try any of them. 

PRICE: Around $5 per beer on tap. Personal pizzas were $9 and large pizzas that could feed 2-3 people were $18. Appetizers were around $5. 

ATMOSPHERE: Pretty neat place. Funny statues, tvs, darts and all wooden furniture. Drawbacks are very small tables, uncomfortable chairs, odd layout, and almost too loud at times. 

SERVICE: The place seemed a little understaffed at times. We would be helped my a couple employees throughout the night as one would have to run behind the bar to make drinks or clean. All the servers were very nice and patient, but seemed to be a little overwhelmed and, thus, forgot to bring me a drink I ordered. 

SKINNY: Papago Brewing Company Inc has its pros and cons, but overall its a good place. I would definitely go there for the beer, while the pizza is good but nothing to rant about. Some may disagree with me, but I still prefer Tempe's own Four Peaks. I feel Four Peaks' food is better, better seating, and the beers are just as good as Papago's flavors. Don't let this comparison discourage you! Papago's is still a good place to drink and eat.",1
"Fun atmosphere and very good service. We liked all of the sports memorabilia. Our server was very attentive, friendly, and patient. The busboys were also very attentive and friendly. We especially were glad to have been given good service even though we did not order any beverages (you'd be surprised at how many servers are rude to us after they discover that we won't be ordering alcohol).

Food was good! We enjoyed: the bread, sweet and sour cabbage soup, caesar salad, baby back ribs, salmon, mashed potatoes, and creme brulee. The chopped liver at the beginning of the meal was also a nice bonus!

Only cons would be that the french fries were mundane. Also, we were a little confused about what was a part of the meal (sides, soups, etc), what was an upcharge, what we couldn't add, etc. It wasn't outlined on the menu, and our server had to explain a couple of times.

The manager came by after to ask how everything was. Very nice!",1
"At first I was disappointed with Padre's menu.  I usually get tacos, rice, and beans, and they only had soft tacos.  But then I ventured out and got this amazing beef burrito that came with rice and beans.  Really glad I tried it.

I was also pleased to see that they had Sol beer on the menu.  It is my favorite Mexican cerveza, and I usually can't find it in restaurants.",1
I never got a chance to try the food because I was so turned off by the way I was treated. My family and I will be waiting for a table across the parking lot at The Cheesecake Factory.,2
"I must hand it to them at Olive and Ivy! First rate atmosphere and food.
The pesto is the most flavorful I have ever had and that includes pesto I have eaten in Italy.
Wine selection is terrific. The breakfast, lunch and dinners are wonderful. The bar feels a bit like a meat market but that is the only down side.
It is beautiful, clean and worth returning to again and again.",1
"This place screams, ""NO""!  

Indoor seating?  No.  I ate outside in the heat.  

Water?  No.  I asked for a cup of water with my meal and was told they only have bottled water and soda for sale.  

Straws?  No.  I walked to Safeway to get a gatorade and they don't even have a straw for me to use.  

Can I use the Now Groupon for a 14"" pizza?  No.  Only good for the 12"".  The groupon wasn't clear and the cashier didn't tell me that until after I ordered and bought the Groupon, which I told him about when I walked in the door.  

To add insult to injury, all toppings cost extra.  some are $1.90 each.  Plan to spend a lot of money and be underwhelmed with mediocre pizza if you don't head the warnings posted here.",2
"A very professional company that takes the time to deal with you on a personal level.  
With great reassurance from Nate and his team they were able to handle the short sale of our home with very little stress and in a timely manner.
They really helped when we thought no one could.  From beginning to end we were always kept informed and they got the job done.",1
"Over-priced for the size of the facility and equipment available. The staff is friendly enough, and seeing as how its the closest 24 hour fitness place in this neighborhood, i suppose they get away with the price :)",0
"In one word...excellent!  My fiancee and I had an amazing time here last summer, when we were upgraded to a Spa Casita Suite because the hotel had found out about our engagement, which happened right before we left for our trip.  The room was huge, the grounds were beautiful, the pool was awesome, and everything there was so peaceful.  The concierge helped us with directions to anywhere we wanted to go and the location was great as well...not far from the main drag, but somewhat hidden from the outside world.  We are hoping to return soon.",1
"We tried this out last night. We won't be back. 

There is no indication when you walk in that it's a seat-yourself restaurant. We stood like idiots at the hostess area until somone asked us if we needed something. 

We sat ourselves, and then sat and sat and sat because there was no server assigned to us. Perhaps that is a reason to seat patrons, so a server knows they've arrived?

Finally, the hostess asked us if anyone had helped us, and she was very polite and took our order. 

Our drinks came out fairly quickly, but then we waited and waited for our food. This would have been understandable if the placed had been packed, but it wasn't. It was maybe 75% full (7:30 on Saturday) and there seemed to be plenty of servers. There was one large party on the patio.

I ordered the vegetarian salad (can't remember what it was called) that advertised avocado, jicama, beans, and other yummy things. When it arrived, there was a tiny little mushy sliver of avocado perched on top, and no more to be found. It was as if someone scraped up the dregs of an avocado from the rind of an empty one and flung it on my salad. It would have been more forgiveable if they had just forgotten it altogether. Also, the white beans were undercooked. 

The pizzas were good. I ordered the local organic vegetable one without cheese, and it came loaded with summer squash, roasted carrots, olives (local? Hmm...), leeks, roasted onions, and the crust was thin and crispy. My husband also enjoyed his pizza. 

I should actually grant an additional half star to the hostess/waitress, who comped my salad when I complained about it. I was willing to pay for it, but she offered to take it off the bill. 

The final nail in the coffin was perhaps not the fault of the restaurant, but the large party out on the patio had 3-4 elementary-age kids literally running laps through the restaurant for the first 15-20 minutes we were there. If ignorant parents are content to let their hellions ruin other diners' experiences, then I'm afraid it's left to the restaruant to politely and discreetely ask the parents to please reign them in. No such luck. 

Anyway, this place has some things to work on. Fortunately for us, there are too many other great businesses nearby for us to give it a second chance.",2

"Ok, this is coming from sombody that is not a fan of the Cheesecake factory.
My cousin, her friend, and I walk into the the restaurant and decided to eat in the bar area.  We had a very sweet waitperson, Summer.  She rocked with suggestions and her personality was great.  I had one of their smoothies, just like the one at Cheesecake Factory.  It was good, but I have had better at Jumba Juice.  I ended up having their angel hair pasta, my cousin had a chicken salad, and friend #3 decided that he would just mooch off our plates.  The reason why I hate these types of places is that they give you WAY TOO MUCH FOOD!  Why do they do that?  Especially with people, like me, that learned that they better clean off their whole plate? I just gained 10 pounds.

Food was nothing spectacular.  My cousin then ordered the Splenda Cheesecake, that she said tastes horrible. (She had the one at Cheesecake Factory, which she thinks is awesome)

5 stars to the lovely Summer (or was it Winter...I can't remember now...crap!)  My cousin actually left her money on the booth.  She called the restaurant and Summer actually said she found it and was holding it for her just in case she came back for it.  Extra plus for honesty that I didn't even think existed in the world anymore.  2 stars for the mediocre food.  And 3 stars to the host stand...a story that I don't have enough energy to even type here.",0
"Simply an AWESOME tuna sandwich! Great service, and the atmosphere was really cool. Just wondering what the difference is between pickles and cucumbers in brine. (50 cents, apparently)",1
"This is a great dog park. There are two sides, a big dog side and a little dog side. There is a little bit of seating but you can bring a chair if you want. There is water for the dogs and pooper scoopers as well. Everyone that visits for the most part is pretty nice except for the occasional crazy lady who tries to discipline other people's dogs. 

The only thing that would make this dog park better would be if it had lights so you could come at night and if it had more shady areas for the hot summers!",1
"$4.00 for a lunch special in Tempe is pretty good, if you ask me.  If you're eating two slices of pepperoni pizza for lunch, I don't think you can complain that your pizza is ""greasy.""  (That's what they invented napkins and dabbing for.  Actually, napkins were probably invented for wiping your face, but they can be used for soaking up grease from pizza too.)  

I don't know that I'll go out of my way for this one, but I won't complain about it either.  If I could give 3 and a half stars I would, so I'll be generous and round up (Barro's, if you're reading this and see my generosity, feel free to return in kind with free lunches for life.  I think that's a fair trade.)",1
"In town for business, and came to Pappadeaux's for dinner...what a great experience.  Hostess, wait staff, and servers were all outstanding.  The food was amazing.  Perfectly cooked vegetables to accompany the Costa Rican Mahi.  Ice cold beer on a hot, 102 degree day was a welcome addition!

Although we later found out our waiter was in training (it was his first day), he was attentive, professional, and available to answer any questions we had.

Highly recommended.",1
Good Date Night Spot!!!  Went here the other night for dinner and it was really good. I had the steak and my wife had the casa dilla of the day.  Both were cooked to perfection.  Sometimes nicer places have really small portions and seem to pay more attention to how pretty the dish is instead of how good it is but this place was spot on with both presentation and taste. We did not have a reservation so we sat at the bar which has full menu service.  The bar wraps around and near the men's restroom there is some additional bar seats that nobody sits at.  I thought this area might have been a little more private than some of the two person tables.  I also thought it was cool to be able to see into the kitchen but that might only be appealing to me.  The bartender was very knowledgeable and checked on us several times during our meal.  This place has a good vibe for couples doing the date night thing but there was also a table of 6 near us who were also having a good time.  Cowboy Ciao is a win win.  The desert donuts are ridiculously good as well.,1
"will review after I eat. Ok so we ordered a Mongolian beef combo plate, sesame chicken (YUM) and pork fried rice , and sweet and sour pork. This was really really  good food. Good prices. When we are in the area we will definitely go back.",1
Steak cooked to perfection.,1
"I have been to this place a couple of times and so far each time has been a great experience for the most part.  The food is awesome, and the atmosphere is fun and friendly (definitely family oriented, with a lot of outdoor seating).

Out of the two times that I have been here, I have tried their fontina burger, the pesto chicken sandwich, the sweet potato fries, and the garlic fries. The burger was delicious, the chicken in the pesto chicken sandwich was cooked to perfection, and the fries were awesome (although, the garlic fries had too much garlic for my taste). 

The only downside is that this place is always packed  (or at least the two times that I have been here).  It was featured on the Food Network, so I kind of knew that it was a popular place. But the funny thing is that I thought if going at a later time for lunch and on a weekday that it wouldn't be bad, but I was wrong and the line was still out the door.  Also, I kind of wanted to try their milkshakes, but the line was way too long to get back into (sort of wish they had an express line for desserts). 

Oh, and check out their restroom for a weird/funny surprise.",1
"We recently took a weekend getaway to Phoenix and stayed here. The Hotel is beautiful and our rooms were spacious and very comfortable. The staff here are topnotch. I love the lobby wine & hot apple cider hour in the afternoons, and the lobby coffee & hot chocolate bars in the mornings. We had access to the Golds Gym across from the hotel and were able to get a good workout in their cardio theatre. There is an outdoor skating rink right outside and a small shopping/dining area. It is located right across from the stadium and could walk to our event. I would definitely recommend staying here, especially if you are attending an event at the arena.",1
"Chai is alive and well, and living at City Center at City North.

I had been dating a gal name Starbucks for the past few years. She was a plain gal, generic if you will.  She was dependable and available. I was feeling as if i needed more out of my relationship, as you can imagine. 
So, at times, I would cheat on my gal with another gal named Coffee Bean. Coffee Bean was Kosher and a bit edgier, yet had a leaner list of qualities. 

I needed more out of my relationships. They say that when you're not looking for someone new, they appear. Well, that was the case with my new crush named Press. 

I had been to High Street for dinner Kona Grill, yet most of the other shops and restaurants were closed or not yet open for business at the time. 

I ventured back during daytime hours to give them another opportunity.  I had heard about Press, so I was more than excited to give it a go. At this point I was still making caffeine a part of my diet, so i ordered something called a ""Dirty Chai."" This was a Chai with espresso shots. Press uses a powdered Chai which, in my opinion, works better than the liquid or tea bag forms. I was also given the option to have my frothy delight in a ceramic cup.  I opted for that.  I felt like i was having the type of coffee house experience I had only just imagined. 

Press occupies a well appointed space, too.  From the wood and granite, to the stained concrete floors, I felt as if i were in a European city, not a Phoenix strip mall. The free wi-fi is a major plus, in my opinion. 
Press goes as far as to have a ""dog friendly"" cart outside, in its ample outdoor seating area. 

I spoke with Steve, the owner of Press, at length.  In talking, I asked how Press came to be, and he said that his wife had wanted to open a coffee shop one day.  Well Steve, you have certainly exceeded her expectations, as well as the residents of the Greater Phoenix area. 

By the way, Press serves sandwiches and soups, as well as an extensive list of wines. 

Check it out, the staff will make you feel at home, or like you're on vacation in the cozy European city of your choice.",1
"This 2 stars is extremely generous. Wanna know why? Read on.

My party of 7 and a baby got to Pappadeux's around 6:30. We were told that it would be a 30-minute wait. It ended up being more than an hour. We were standing right in front of the hostess station, yet no one ever came to give us updates on how long it would be for our table. We would go check about every 20 or so minutes. One time we were told that our table was ready. When we went to check on it after about 20 minutes we were told that they were waiting on a busboy to clean it. A few minutes later they were still waiting on a busboy. In what universe does it take a restaurant 30 minutes to find a busboy to clean a table? We watched group after group after group get seated. A group of 7 that came after us was seated before us. We ended up being sat next to them; by the time we were getting our menus, they were finishing up their meals.

Once we were finally seated, we waited almost 10 minutes before someone came to our table to introduce himself as our waiter. When he asked how we were doing, we kindly told him that we were a little frustrated because it had taken more than twice as long as we were told, and we had been told twice that they were waiting on a busboy to clean the table. The waiter said that it was a busy night and said that he didn't get paid to deal with unhappy customers. He asked, ""So are you gonna do this or what?"" WHAT?! It was so rude - I don't know how he meant it, but it came across as sounding extremely annoyed. We were appalled and my boyfriend asked to speak to a manager.

The manager came over and spoke with my boyfriend. Not sure what was said, but after that things got much better. The manager brought us an appetizer plate on the house. Our food ended up being really good - including the alligator. I got shrimp etoufee, and it was great. The gumbo wasn't so fabulous. Overall, everyone was satisfied with their meal. We got three different drinks, and they basically tasted the same: like cherry Nyquil.

The food was good, but it's not always about the food. The service was horrible. Don't think I'd ever go there again. There are too many other places with great food and equally great service.",2
"Very consistent, thin crust pizza, made with fresh ingredients and excellent cheese! The market place is lively and the atmosphere is festive!",1
Huge line for incompetent employees who don't even know how to wash cars.,2
"Every time I head to Phoenix, I have to head to Chino Bandido. The food is in large portions and very filling! It is interesting how Mexican and Chinese food come together but it seems to work as this place was packed. I ordered the vegetarian quesadillas and it was loaded in raw veggies but I would have liked to remove the cheese and I was not sure if I could because it was so packed in there! 

Try the food out, you will not be disappointed.",1
"I lived off Salazar Bros my first year of college because I lived right near it.  Must have eaten there twice a week minimum.  I was heartbroken when it turned into Armando Bros because as much as people told me they just changed their name, they didn't.  It was a different restaurant.  

I had written it off as another great place gone to the pages of history until I moved near 48th and Baseline, and 'lo and behold there was Salazar's, tucked away in the Fry's parking lot next to a Little Caesars and a clothing outlet that appears to have escaped from the mall.  

The interior itself is cheaply thrown together and completely forgettable.  The only thing the employees seem to care about is making food.  And none of this bothers me because they make some damn amazing food for cheap prices.

I recommend the adobada burrito with extra sour cream and 2 things of red sauce.  It's pork brushed with a delicious sauce of some sort.  Comes with pico and guacamole.  I sometimes have to convince myself to try something new off the menu.  Brownie points for carrying Pepsi products as well, I take Mountain Dew with my burritos.",1
"I, like another reviewer, was not willing to fight for lunch at McDonald's... and so I travelled up the road to Burger King. I haven't been to a BK in years and have heard several quips about their ""new and updated menu."" 

I got a Whopper Jr. meal (no update there). Their fries are good, more satisfying than other fast food restaurants-- ""now with sea salt""-- as if that makes them more appealing. 

The Whopper Jr. itself is just... meh.. I'm sorry, I don't do mayo. I do appreciate the fresh (?) veggies on top though. 

Soda seems syrupy here to me.

If McDonald's is busy, head here. They DO have a nice outdoor patio, though. And Iike their workers' uniforms better. Does that count??",0
"Eden's Grill has to be one of my favorite, and newly discovered Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant in the PHX metro. Located in a sleepy strip mall, close to Artie's Ace, is EG. My partner and I had the opportunity to have dinner here a few weeks ago and we were totally wowed by everything! We started off with the hummus, followed by two orders of the vegetarian plate. The vegetarian plates were huge and featured dolmades, falafel, rice, veggie skewers and veggie patties (2). The vegetarian plate was massive and everything on the plate was delicious. Next time we'll pay the extra $5 and split one Vegetarian Plate instead of getting two. The pita and hummus were fresh and delicious, however, I find EG's hummus to be a a little thick for my preference and they use a heavy dose of tahini in their hummus. Overall, I would totally recommend EG to anyone with an itch for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food but be warned, they aren't open for lunch on the weekends yet.",1
"In a sentance: Four Peaks is DEFINATLY something to write Yelp about! From the moment I realized that there were more reviews about this place than I'd care to read in one sitting, I knew this was going to be good!! I realized it was going to be fantastic when i pulled up with my friend Darius and we had a hard time finding a parking spot at 3pm. We met a friend for lunch and the place was laid back, chill, clean, cozy and yet modern - perfect. 

I had the French Dip, thinly sliced roast beef on a nice hogie bun. Everything was good not too salty not too greasy, loved it! Darius got the Fish N Chips and it was incredible!! Crispy batter dipped big pieces of fish, iot was crispy and crunchy but soft and delightful on the inside. The chips were also batter dipped and had great flavor. I was in love! this is my best recommendation for a meal at Four Peaks!

To my yelpers i say: there is limited parking, so when you pull up and see nothing but cars lining the street, do NOT be alarmed! there will be a table available! Another thing, get the fish n chips! It's duh-vine!",1
"When I mean 5 star, I mean 5 STARR...but this place is SPECTACULAR!! Pavle & Charleen are such a fantastic duo....they really know how to make your dining experience exquisite!  The food, not to mention the service, is truly unbelievably delicious!! If you want to have some amazing food and get top notch service while doing so, the time has come for you right here in beautiful Arizona!!
HATS OFF FOR FnB!!",1
"My first and only experience there was excellent. The service was exemplary - the server knew the menu, was enthusiastic about it, and assisted us in choosing our items without being pushy. The food was exceptionally prepared and tasted excellent. The tzatziki was the best I've had. Nice and thick, with cucumber and spiced well with herbs and garlic. The spanikopita was also exceptionally with fresh clean tasting spinach and delicately textured phyllo dough. The pan fried calamari reminded me of Europe, fresh tasting, delicately fried in olive oil and not in the least bit chewy. The pita bread was warm and fresh and for dessert, the baklava had a complex flavor and tasted home made. 

The environment was tasteful, old world European and exceptionally clean and organized. I will be back!",1
"I have been here a couple of times as it is about a block from where I live. It is your typical neighborhood bar. That is, not a lot of people, average prices, okay happy hour.

Their menu is bar food. Burgers, Wings, Fries, and so on. The have the standard domestics on tap (Bud, Coors, Miller etc).

A lot of times they have live music at 9 or 10. If this is for you then you have the chance to see an exclusive performance since not a lot of patrons are there. However, it gets pretty loud. So if this does not sound like your thing, be aware what time it is. 

Service is pretty bad if you are in the ""restaurant"" part. The only time I have eaten at a table the bartender was also our server. Needless to say slow is an understatement. 

The only reason I go here is so I don't have to drive anywhere. 2 stars because I have experienced better, much better. My experiences tells e that the Waterfront is just a corner bar. Nothing Special.",2
"2 stars all because the hot sauce sucks now. 2 stars: 1 for a Buckeye Icon and 1 for most of the food is not bad. 
Service is bad and slow. Servers are not trained in good service skills. Dirt parking lot sucks, be carefull not fall into one of the holes.
Hope you are not handicapted and have to use the bathroom.....it's outside and to the left, suprised the Building department OK'd this place.",2
"I must have looked like a poor, ugly person the other day bc seriously NO ONE helped me. no one even said hi. I was in there for an hour too. 

I decided not to buy anything bc the service was so bad. 

this is a little bit like OJ's ""i didnt kill my wife, but if I did this is how I would do it"" in that if someone had helped me I would have bought 6 place settings- mats, chargers, napkins and napkin rings. I also would have bought several drapery panels. 

but no way was I going to spend that much money at a place that couldn't even say hello or ask a girl carrying around a ton of place settings if she needed help. 

so i just set everything I had gathered up over the hour in a pile and left. you're welcome employees, hope you had fun putting everything away. i also hope they work on commission and are regretting not saying hi to me.",2
"It's kinda comfy setting....For the Non-(official), Yelp event, they had penne pasta...but Sonoma's specialty is rotisserie chicken......Nice but I sure would have liked to taste what the place raves about---Chicken!  Oh well, the pasta was ok for what it was.  What I truly enjoyed about Sonoma was the layout.  You can easily entertain a fairly large crowd and not be on top of each other.  I need to come back and try their chicken then re-write this review.

The parking upstairs for the event was nice also, but later on at night, it seems a bit spooky to be walking up in the parking area alone and in the middle of city center where there are some pretty curious characters about~~~I would prefer coming with more than one person if parking at night in the upper garage (personal preference).

The Yelp folks!---Way too cool!  I am so glad to have discovered Yelp!  Best thing I've done in ages.---Cheers Yelpers!",0
"bank building turn to a coffee beanery is way cool. 

plenty of seats to settle yourself in and crack open your books and do your homework. the free wi-fi is helpful too, but the connection lags sometimes when their a bunch of people hopping online to check their myspace.

it gets chilly at time, i suggest bring a sweater if you're the unlucky one seated underneath the A/C vent. 

the vault room is great when trying to escape the loud chatter in the main room, just don't forget to turn off your cell phone when you're in there, it's kind of rude...

if you wanna be shaking out of your pants, i suggest the Iced Toddy. it's strong and it should keep you up all night if you have a big project the following day.

customer service is very nice and helpful.",1
"If you're looking for a good meal with solid service you'll find it here.  The menu has something for everyone, too.  If you like to go out for lunch or brunch, this is a great place to go.  Friendly, fast staff helps make the experience that much better.",1
The oatmeal cookie frozen yogurt here is amazing.  The place is small but accomodating enough to get your yogurt and find a seat.  It's similar to Yogurtini and the other places like this.  Last time I came here I saw a guy with the most awesome 80s blonde mullet I have ever laid eyes on. Rock on.,1
"I can't believe I haven't wrote a review for Ted's yet! By far, one of my favorite places to go. You can get full off of some tasty food for a great price. I normally get a hot dog with mayo, onion, hot sauce and a pickle. I also like the corn dog and onion rings. I can always get a satisfying and fulfilling meal for $5-7. Love it!

Can get a little crowded on the weekends, but generally all the people are pretty fast and nice.",1
"This was the first place my husband to me out to eat out when we started dating, OMG I loved it. The staff is always extremely nice prompt at this location, we enjoy their food and I epically am in love with the 99 cent margaritas they are the best. We always have a wonderful time here new and old memories.",1
"Great place. Sushi was not wrapped up tied enough so it tended to fall apart. Also the roll was a bit thick that it is hard to fit it in your mouth (yeah, that's what she said:)",1
I used Full Circle Auto Body after my daughter's car was in an accident. They were very knowledgable and helpful about insurance issues and got the car repaired quickly. They post progress of your vehicle with photos on their website which is so cool. I'll definitely use them again if the occassion arises.,1
"Prolly one of the best and definetly one of the better Chinese places in town. they deliver pretty late which is always convienent and have the best house fried rice, wonton soup, beef lo mein, and their honey walnut shrimp is average. The white rice tends to be a bit dry, but overall they have always been pretty nice, and always throw in free crab puffs for free when you order over a certain amount. Definetly the go to place for fair priced, yummy Chinese food!",1
"I found Cake Frenzy through an service listing on Craigslist while looking for someone to create our wedding cake/cupcakes. Not only were we on a tight budget we only had about 2 1/2 months to plan for the venue we wanted only had a few dates available. I met Jennifer about a month prior, my fiance' and I knew we wanted a peanut butter & jelly cake and she happily obliged. I emailed her a picture of what I wanted and the day of our wedding when I first saw our cake I almost cried. She went above and beyond my expectations. The cake was beautiful with sugar flowers and gelatin butterflies. All of our guests loved the flavor combinations and the decorations. I highly recommend Cake Frenzy, she is professional, she takes pride in her work and extremely reasonable.",1
"The food is fantastic, the staff is helpful and the atmosphere is comfortable. 

The food at El Bravo just tastes better than the food at any other Mexican restaurant I have been to in Phoenix, regardless of price. The cheese is amazing! 

I love their flour tortilla flautas , crispy beef tacos, cheese crisps, enchiladas (I could go on and on). 

I really can see no reason to go anywhere else in Phoenix for Mexican food. 

I highly recommend El Bravo.",1
"The main advice I would give anyone interested in dining at Postino Arcadia would be: ""Prepare to Fight.""  Prepare to fight for a parking space and prepare to fight for the bruschetta which is to die for.  My favorites would have to be the Smoked Salmon and Pesto, Apple and Brie, Prosciutto and Fig and Warm Artichoke.  Plus, you cannot beat a bottle of vino and 4 types of bruschetta for $20 every Monday and Tuesday after 8pm!

I am also a huge fan of their Pretzel Pub Board and NYC Grilled Cheese that is companied by a Sierra Nevada Mustard, Pesto and Ketchup dipping sauces, washed down with a cold Stella Artois Lager Belgium.  These menu items have sparked inspiration for me to make similar dishes in my own kitchen more than a time or two.  So grab some good company, a bottle of vino paired with bruschetta and prepare for a relaxing-enjoyable night out.

Don't forget the Affogato (vanilla bean ice cream topped with espresso) to give ya a jolt for your car ride home.",1
"I was last at this place in 2004, and it was great.  My favorite band was playing and I had a great time dancing, drinking and just listening to music.  It's a must-see for any rhythm and blues fan.  Of course, it wasn't open when I just visited.  Ah well.  But still a good place to catch a show.",1
"The best example North Scottsdale has of traditional Phoenix sonoran mexican food.  Los Olivos restaurants have been around forever - at least since the '60's.  The food is great if not fancy, and the place is pretty free of gimmicks.  You can get your fix of cheese crisps (aka quesadillas for you CA transplants), deep fried tacos, chimichangas, combination plates with so much sauce and cheese you can't tell what's underneath but it all works together to taste so good.  Los Olivos still plops down the free chips and salsa right when you sit down so you're good an full when that combo plate comes and glad for it.  The atmosphere is more like a nice mexican diner than mexican cantina and service is solid. They often have mariachis playing on weekend nights.  Margaritas aren't great, but the beer is cold.  Don't bother with dessert.  Cheap eats for all the food, especially since you won't be hungry for another 24 hours.  If you're in North Scottsdale and in the mood for traditional Phoenix style mexican food, Los Olivos is a great choice.",0
"This place is a most see must do during xmas time! The staff is always friendly, drinks are reasonable and the place is always packed on the weekends. It is a must because of their un beatable holiday spirit. This place is top to bottom decked out with lights wrapping paper and anything shinny and colorful.",1
"Velvet wallpaper adorn the dimly lit  walls here, and make you feel like Dean Martin might sit at the table next to you. Old school, in the classic sense. I used to work across the street from here, and would stop in from time to time for a great happy hour, occasional employee lunch for my staff or a special occasion dinner from time to time. Being from New England, it says a lot when I admit that they have the best Oysters Rockefeller I have ever had. Ever. The steaks are just wonderful, and the martinis perfectly poured. But you know what secret thing I ADORE about this place (besides the back entrance through the kitchen)? The bread. Warm white rolls smothered in a garlicky-leek chutney of some sort. For all those times your Mom told you not to fill up on bread, just disregard. She never had this bread. While I think you should always splurge here for a fantastic dinner, the real bargains are lunch and Happy Hour.",1
"This is an open-air mall.  Unlike most malls which are totally enclosed, this mall is outdoors.  In the outdoor area they sometimes have ""events"".  The Batman ""Tumbler"" was there for a day once, we've heard concerts here, and this last visit they had a sculling team there with their boat.

They have many of the usual shops (American Eagle, Gap, Aeropostale, Victoria's Secret, etc).   The Harkins Theater hear is pretty nice.  We like the Genghis Grill for food (see my review of them).  The Paradise Bakery is nice also.  There are several other eateries here, but we haven't tried most of them yet.  However, several choices are available.

This is a nice mall to just wander and shop, and eat and drink, and enjoy whatever is going on.",1
"I am leaving this store angry and can't resist writing a review! 

The staff is incredibly useless....if you can actually find someone to help you. The store is huge with very little signs to guide you. Therefore I always wander aimlessly looking for the one simple thing I stopped in for (even though I tell myself I will never go back) with no one to help me. 

Today they were out of an item I bought last week and need more of to finish my project. I asked the only 100 year old lady I could find to check the back and she told me they have nothing in back and to ask customer service. The lady at customer service was actually a reasonable age and when I asked her to call the Indian Bend store she handed me their number and said ""well you can call them"". I stormed out soooo mad and this time I promise to never go back. Hobby Lobby or Michaels is worth the drive!!!",2
"Originally came by to get a watering system for our chickens and ended up buying something for every member of our furry family! They have everything here for cats, dogs, small birds, rabbits, poultry, horses and more! The customer service was excellent, we were even given free samples for our chickens without even asking and were given informational sheets about some awesome products we ended up buying as well. Both of the people working were concerned with taking their time to help us, not about making a sale, and will even special order some products for us if ever needed. We don't feed our dogs dry food anymore (they now eat raw instead), but when we did, these are the premium/healthiest brands we were buying at a much higher cost at other retailers.

The prices are low, the hours are convenient, the customer service was great, the products are healthy, and the selection was large for how small the shop is, what more could you ask for? Great first visit and we will definitely be coming back again!",1
"Well Sauce hits the ""spot"" for me. I was amazed how quick the service is and how fast we get our pizza (well their  pizza does follow the laws of physics, THIN PIES COOK QUICK!). So if your're looking for deep dish....this is not spot. But if you like it thin, it's great. I tend to order the same item time and time again and it's the sausage with carmelized onions. Sandra K likes their salads, so it's a pizza and salad and we share. She likes a glass of red wine with her dinner. We share the pizza and salad (she won't let me drink her wine though) and I gotta tell you, it's plenty of food and I feel like I got real value for my money. Kudo's to Sauce!

This guy, Sam Fox, has a magic touch with most of his restaurantsl He is truly gifted by bringing his concepts to the greater Phoenix area.",1
"There really isn't much I like about Michael's to begin with - I especially dislike them for using my name and putting on such an inferior showing - but this location was a particular disaster.  Clean up your aisles for goodness sake, I feel claustrophobic with all the crap hanging around - its like the clothing section at K-Mart, but possibly worse.",2
"What a dream come true to traipse into this store with my toddler girl and my husband. The store is filled, ceiling to floor, with all varieties of toys for all age groups. Shelves upon shelves of brands and models you've likely never seen if your main toy-shopping stomping grounds are Toys R Us or Walmart. The store's management clearly has a relaxed attitude about children playing in the store -- toys are sprawled across the store,  ready for the next child's little hands. Yet, it didn't feel messy in there. The aisles are wide and smooth. The store is organized into various zones. (Dolls, science, blocks, books, baby, etc.)  This is an absolute oasis in suburbia land where you're always hard-pressed to find non-chain stores.",1
"I've been here a grand total of three times, and I probably won't be returning any time soon.  It's not that the food is flat out bad, per se, it's just that there are many better options nearby. The first time I went on a recommendation, and the food was... OK. The 2nd time I went the food was still only... OK. The third time... well, you get the picture.

The first obvious knock against Rosita's Place is the chips and salsa. They're not bad, but they're not complimentary. Given all the competition which offer free chips and salsa, you'd think these would have to be pretty darn special, but they're not. Good, but not outstanding.

Secondly, the rice and beans are just OK (that descriptor keeps coming up in this review). The chicken enchiladas were fresh, but lacked any real flavor or spice. The machaca, which is supposed to be  one of their specialties, was soggy... a BIG no-no for a dish that is a specialty in this region.

So, honestly, while I wouldn't discourage anyone from going here, I'm not sure what some of the hype is about, especially when Rito's, Tacos De Juarez, and Comedor Guadalajara aren't that far away.",0
"Been there, done that.  Fair sandwiches (better than Safeway, anyway).  Only 2 stars since I didn't know about the free soft serve, so didn't get to try that.

There's gotta be a good New York-style deli west of the 17 and north of Thunderbird.  Isn't there?  Doesn't have to be great.  Good would be wonderful.",2
This place has not gotten any better over the past 10 years. The service is still bad and they are always running out of food and the food isn't that great either.  Will have to say that I will not be going back to this location or the one off of Glendale and 19th ave.,2
Next Door Realty is fantastic!  Daradee Murray handled the short sale of my home recently and the entire transaction went unbelievably smooth.  From start to finish she was an excellent communicator.  She took all of our concerns into account and made the process a breeze for us.  I would highly recommend Next Door to anyone looking to buy or sell a home.  The personal attention you receive is unparalleled!,1
"I always have customer service problems with Fedex.  How the heck did they get to be so big with the crappy way they treat customers?  I use the Internet a lot for purchases and about 60% of the time, they screwed-up and then their customer service has major difficulty fixing the problems.  I have asked for shipments to be held at the closet shipping location to my office and they ship to my home.  Another time I asked for the same thing and they held it at the regional depot instead of where I asked that it be sent.  I can go on and on about the screw-ups I have experienced with Fedex.  

But this time they really pissed me off.  I get a harassing phone calls from a collection agency that says they have been contracted by Fedex to collect an overdue bill from me in the amount of $4000+.  I have asked them for details and all I get is harassment.  So I asked Fedex for help and customer service told me to contact Fedex Revenue Services, which I did.  I told them that I am getting harassing phone calls from XYZ collection agency and the person who keeps calling is named Chris.  I also tell them that the alleged amount owed is $4000+ and the account is supposedly in my name.  So I ask that they investigate and tell me if I indeed have an overdue account in my name for this amount.  (I know I do not have such an account!).  Fedex then tells me that they cannot help me because I have not provided enough information.  WTF?  How much more information can I provide?  Do they want my height and weight?  Maybe my blood type?  Maybe I have to provide the names and birth dates of my children too?

This is why I say that Fedex really blows!",2
"Clean, modern hotel with spacious suites including decent sized refrigerators (easily accommodates a 30 pack). 
Staff was fantastic and went out of there way to work around hiccups. Local shuttle, free breakfast, managers reception in the evenings; and all within walking distance of Scottsdale Stadium.",1
Stopped in for a business breakfast. I had the Chilaquiles with scrambled eggs. It was great. It's not really on my side of town but I'd really like to go back and try some other dishes. Hefty portions at great prices. All four of us ate well for under $40 including drinks.,1
"Long ago, Salvation Army used to be the place to go when you thought of ""thrift stores"". Sadly, this place is WAY overpriced for being a thrift store. I have chatted with other random people who thought the same thing about this one - way too expensive!  :(

I don't know who is pricing this stuff, but they are out of their mind, probably watching too much ""Storage/Auction Wars"" or ""Pawn Stars"" thinking that everything is worth a ton of money.

Goodwill is just up the street on Grand and has better prices.",2
I love vegetarian restaurants! I support them 200%. So glad this place exists in Phoenix. The quality of the food is beyond excellent. The meals are creative and super tasty. Never disappointed. The only qualm I have is the service. It...is...slow. Whether it's the time it takes for my meal to reach my table or the cashier taking my order to ring it up correctly. The length of time it takes should not be so long. Prices are a bit steep but most vegetarian/vegan restaurants are priced a bit higher than others. I don't mind paying more for quality. Overall this place is a favorite weekend visit. I can't wait for my next meal at Pomegranate Cafe.,1
"Whew!  What a hike.  Coming from Colorado, though, the relative comparison makes it just a 3.  

Firstly, it's definitely treacherous.  When we arrived between 730 and 8 on a Saturday morning, there were about four, maybe five firetrucks in the parking area...these rescue/aid teams just camp out there, I think, because of all the doofuses who don't plan accordingly waterwise or overestimate their ability to make this climb.  Also, two different areas of the Echo Canyon trail are especially steep and potentially slick, so they've installed some metal railings to help you along there...but only if you've got some gloves or if the temperature is moderate (uhhhh,...that doesn't really happen in Phoenix during the day in summer), because those damn things get hot enough to fry an egg.  Also - water, water, water.  Bring a LOT, or top off at the start of the trail before you go up (though the water out of that tap attached to the water fountain is about 85 degrees, yuk). 

It was a fun jaunt.  The view was worth it - not entirely picturesque as far as nature goes, but it was nice view of the city and surrounding area.  If you go, just be wary of the sun/heat, and know that you'll be clambering over and around boulders and such.  (If you trip, it's CURTAINS!)",0
"Called last night @ 4:30 and tried to do call ahead seating for 6:30 for a party of 9. We are in town and are here to see some friends. Explained to hostess that some in the group are seniors so would need to have assurance on reservation. I was told to call back in an hour, the thought process by her was that it was too soon to give me a time and they weren't that busy yet. So I did as told and called back and after about 10 minutes of confusion and other waiting I was told we couldn't be seated until 7:30 or we could have seperate booths. I explained that we needed to sit together and 2 hours was the best she could do. I was so frustrated I told her no thanks that we would find other arrangements. She said ok and that was it. Nice job Texas Roadhouse. NOT!!! There is no excuse for not having a reservation system in place, like Open Table. One day there will be no customers to disappoint, then maybe you will get it.",2
"Cool place but don't try to arrange a special event. The proprietor was arragont, unflexible and unethical when I held my friend's bachelorette party at The Duce. Be warned!",2
"Sub Factory is one of the better sub shops in Tempe - They have been around forever and have a reputation of using the highest quality, freshest ingredients. They may need to give this location a ""make-over"" soon though... it's getting a little tired. (FYI - their secret weapon is their bread)",1
"Just went tonight.  Was looking for some late night Mexican food and atmosphere a step above most things that are open this late and found success.

This place is definitely trying to pull off cool and I think they do a pretty good job of it.  Their expansive selection of Tequila, enhances the mood they set out to create.

I do not like that you had to pay for chips and salsa but the food was pretty cheap for how nice the restaurant was, so I think it evens out.  

They might charge for chips because it's the kind of restaurant where you could spend several hours drinking and if people ate chips the whole time that was happening it wouldn't be profitable.  I say this because their alcohol is a good deal.  16 oz. Dos Equis for four bucks on tap and it wasn't happy hour!

This place is a balance of modestly priced mexican, drinking and nice atmosphere.  The food is not amazing but it's good, and with the atmosphere and wanting to eat at 11 at night this restaurant/bar is overall impressive.  (If weren't for the late late night aspect would probably only give it three stars)",1
Great food and even better beer. Staff are always friendly.  My favorite microbrewery in the Valley.,1
"Decent Chinese food. I go often for take out. It is easy and convenient for those in central phoenix. I have had times where some of the food is great and other times it was bad. Support local restaurants, this beats panda express!",0
"I've eaten here twice, and both times enjoyed myself immensely.

  First, note that this is the smaller location; the one in Mesa has more tables and space. This one is closer to me, so this is the one I go to, but if you are looking to have a large group, you may wish to go to the Mesa location.

   That said, I really like this one. The mood is very raw, because of the small size, even at a table you can see the cooks behind the bar, hear the clatter and clang of the kitchen. That said, you can still have conversations here without issue; you just have a bit of background noise.

   The food, though...the food is spectacular. Seriously, look at that menu, look at those pictures. The first time I was there I had the chicken tikka masala pasty. Not as good chicken tikka as a straight up Indian restaurant, of course, but still phenomenal, and the pasty just made it that much better. I also snagged the bananoffee pie. It could easily provide dessert for two people; I ate the whole thing. It was just that good. Not too sweet, very banana-y...

   Eat here. It's really that simple. 

   Also, as a tip, there's a parking lot 'round the back that is usually not full, unlike the one on the front. And, though the address is off of University Drive, the front is really facing Hardy. Threw me a bit the first time I was looking for it.",1
"I cook better pasta than them, and I am not much of a cook.

The pasta I had (I believe it was a marinara dish with penne pasta) was awfully bland.
Sauce didn't mix well with the pasta either.
The texture of the pasta was funky, hanging out on its own.
If I wanted bland pasta I would buy a can of Presto and penne pasta, boil them together and add some water :p

The server was attentive enough to notice and brought me more sauce.

I did like the service and how they had the giant white piece of paper and crayons on the table so I could doodle while I waited.

The waitress was very attentive and friendly.

Appetizer: calamari was yummy.

I just wish they could kick it up a notch on the pasta with richer sauces, seasoning, texture, more tomato/meat/cheese and really blending it with their pasta.
 
But I guess that would raise costs/prices huh. :/",2
"We were on our way to the Heard Museum...but diverted to Sabor Cubano.  I was in the car with my mom-in-law (married a Cuban), sister-in-law (1/2 Cuban), and aunties.  And we kept talkin' about Cuban food.  Mom mentioned a Cuban restaurant nearby, but couldn't remember the name.  Thanks to yelp and my droid, we found it!

I had the signature Cuban sandwich.  This might have the been the best one I have ever had in my life.  The bread, the pork, the ham, pickles, cheese was delicious.  I finished my sandwich and felt really guilty that I brought none back for my hubbie.  To top it off, I had a cortadito and thick creamy flan.  Bad wife - hee hee.  (We will come back here, definitely before heading back to the OC.)

The only drawback...service was slow.  But it was well worth the wait.",1
"In a reasonably late scramble for dinner, this pizza place was quite a find.

The location isn't altogether promising, right next to a Circle K and tucked in an itty bitty end in a strip mall. There are only about 7 table. Yet the owner, whose service was excellent, makes the most of the situation. 

The wife and I split a margherita pizza. Out first, though, is the appetizer, which was small pieces of pita-like flatbread served with balsamic vinegar served over a tomato and celery salsa cruda. Nom. Worth eating in for. 

The pizza itself was a thin crust... The crust was decent, the cheese was good, and both the basil and tomato very fresh. It must be nice having ready access to fresh versions of both year-round!

We were very happy with our meal. Pizza A Metro should be on your short list for a good Italian pizza in the area.",1
"So I came here in search for Phoenix's best Macaroni and Cheese. Yep, that's right, me and the inner kid in me are in search of the best Macaroni and Cheese. 

So, ordering was simple!

So, how was it? Pretty good! It was more cheddary than, say, Beckett's Table (which got me started on this dance).

The atmosphere was pretty cool there. However our wonderfully bubbly waitress probably came over way too much. Also, nobody coming over to refill our drinks (iced tea) could figure out that we had tea and not water. Oh well.

On a separate note, I've gone by this place around 2AM it looks like a madhouse. Could be a rather interesting time around 2AM!",1
Long waits and teenage workers with bad attitudes...nuff' said.,2
"I absolutely love the atmosphere and vibe of Switch.  I've been there 3 times, once for a latenight snack (before they were serving alcohol) and twice for breakfast.  My favorite thing about it is that I feel completely comfortable going by myself with a book and lingering over breakfast and coffee.

Service is always very quick and super friendly, and prices are good.  Unfortunately, as much as I love GOING to switch, I have to be honest and say I haven't been wowed by the food so far, although I still need to try lunch/dinner.  Food's not bad, not at all, just nothing spectacular.

Having said that though, I'll still go back often!",1
"The price and pho was awesome. The waiter was great with helping me figure out what to get. Tried #11, loved the beef tendon and tender meat but not a fan of the meatballs (there was a tiny bone in mine). I am a spoiled NYC bahn mi eater so the bahn mi wasn't my favorite (I thought the meat was too fatty) but the boyfriend liked the BBQ pork bahn mi. I also love the do it yourself take home containers, homemade hot sauce, and I even heard they will refill your broth. Bring an appetite, even with the normal size I was stuffed!",1
"Owned by a serious, James Beard nominee, this is high taste, funky fun for killer Mexican food.  We sat at the bar, and joked with the cool bartenders for a while; all the time trying a myriad of different tacos.  Every single one was great!  This is the real deal, with a creative edge.",1
"I love this place, I want to go to Arizona just to eat here!  The greek fries were really good and different.  It was just really really good. 

We're going next time I'm in town Fervor!",1
"We went to this place for my birthday, wanting to try out something new. We'd never had Ethiopian food and we were very adventurous. Be warned, we had a GPS and we had a very hard time finding it, it's tucked away in a little corner!

Once we found it and stepped inside, we were definitely wow'd! The waiter answered our questions about the food, and suggested that if we really want the Ethiopian experience, to try out the Strictly Vegan combo. We ordered Tikil Gomen, Misir Watt, Kik Misir Watt, Gomen Watt, Shuro Watt, and the Dubba. We fell in love with the Shuro and the Misir Watt. The Shuro is chickpeas in a cinnamon/spicy sauce, and the Misir is spiced lentils. Soooo tasty! Even non-vegetarians will enjoy this place, and they do have meat dishes.",1
this place is amazing!  So many flavors to choose from!!!!  I LOVE this place!!!!,1
"I've learned to expect very little from airport restaurants.  Now I've been ruined - I went to Blanco and my paltry expectations were blown out of the water. Prompt and attentive service, flavorful and delicious food, and a delightful assortment of drink options.  I'll have to connect through Phoenix for the rest of my life. 

I had the grilled shrimp salad, which was fresh, flavorful, and filling. I also had the sangria, which was pretty good. My friends had tacos (fish and carnitas); they practically licked their plates clean.  Try the rice - it is a rich and delectable treat. 

An added bonus: They were patient as we sat for three hours waiting for our connecting flight. If I ever find myself in this airport again, you can be sure I'll make my way here.",1
"Best Thai I have found in Phoenix, so far.  This is not just excellent Thai food for Phoenix, this is excellent Thai food for the Bay Area.  It's that good.  Thai Lahna's food will intrude into your thoughts for days after you eat here.  Like gustatory flashbacks, you will find yourself thinking about how wonderfully flavorful everything was.

We had dinner here with Christine O & Myles (+1) and shared 2 appetizers and 4 entrees.  We had Chicken Satay and Angel Wings.  The Satay was the least interesting item we had, it was merely good.  Everything else was great.

Our entrees were Phaht Thai which we ordered with no spice and Khung Nahm Prik Pow which was sauteed shrimp with roasted curry paste, onions, chili, bell peppers and mushrooms.  Our friends ordered a spicy pineapple fried rice and a beef dish which I can't recall the name of.  All of the dishes were richly flavorful and had plenty of sauce to carry over to the steamed rice.

One enjoyable highlight was the point counter-point going from the spicy heat of the rice to the almost sweet sauciness of the Phaht Thai.  We can't wait to get back here and try more dishes.

My only complaint about this place is that they need to put some sort of tinting on the windows to a height of about 3 feet.  When cars are pulling into the spots right in front of the restaurant some diners were blinded by the headlights.",1
"LOVED THE SWITCH WITH JENNIFER ANISTON what is wrong with film

"Favorite Pho in the phoenix area so far.  
Great, tender meat in my pho chin nam (#8).
I see they also have bun bo hue on the menu so I'll have to try that sometime soon.    
Nom nom.

Friendly staff.

See ya there!",1
"After a business trip, I reeeeeally needed a massage. Facility was alright. I personally think it needs an upgrade.  Right off the bat, the area with the lockers (and really where you would get nakey!) is very public...that's the first area that everyone walks through.

The outside lounge area was also VERY tiny.  I went out there and walked right back in because it was full with little privacy.  By that I mean I walked out there and BAM!  A large naked woman scared me back inside.  Really?  G. D. people!  I'm trying to relax.  Naked out of shape people stress me out!  Just ONCE, I want to see a naked hot person walking around.  And if a woman goes nakey, do some basic maintenance first although that much hair does prevent seeing everything, so it may be a blessing...ugh, you know what?  Just stay clothed.  Please?

But my masseuse totally made up for that.  60 minutes of amazing...I forgot all about business and naked people who should be naked in private! 3 stars because Joelle worked magic! She was great and super friendly.  Even though the facilities weren't the best, I would consider returning for her massage.",0
"On top of how good the food is, their customer service is excellent. I went to eat there on Thursday (the 16th), and had the best server ever. He was the bartender as well, and still payed tons of attention to my table. He was very nice, and very helpful. He had extensive knowledge of the menu. He was also very personable. He laid out samples of their various barbeque sauces while giving some details about each one. He squirted them out onto an extra plate he brought to the table, and he made the shape of a smiley face with all the sauces. He made that dining experience so good that I wish I could write a review about him personally and suggest to his managers that he get a raise! I couldn't hear him when he stated his name over a large group that had just come in and was moving tables, but he was wonderful.
  Also, one of the people with me is from the east coast, and likes vinegar-based barbeque sauce. They didn't have any of that kind in their current rotation of sauces, and he actually went back to the kitchen and explained the situation. A lady from the kitchen made a vinegar-based barbeque sauce from scratch just because one of us had mentioned how much we loved it.
   I've never experienced service like that, and really can't say enough about how great this guy, and all other staff I came into contact with, was! Great job to whoever hired him.
  The food was delicious, I love their fries! Unlike anything you can get anywhere else. I got the country roasted chicken- great seasoning, super moist and tender, while still having that chargrilled/roasted skin (my favorite). All of their sauces are so good; it's hard to choose just one! (And no matter how many times I go there, I always sample each one again).
  All positive things to say about this Famous Daves!
Oh- and I forgot to mention the corn muffins...beyond words! Seriously, you have to try them. Now I'm craving one, and I'm pretty sure they're not open at 3:00 a.m. I wish I could order them by the dozen haha",1
"They must have renovated this place in the last year. It is now spacious and airy and there is no longer the dreaded ""hover over a table to get a seat"" necessity.  It now reminds me much more of the dreaded ""Panera Bread"" chain in California, but the food is still much better and has much less of a ""mass produced"" feeling and taste.

The service (management, staff etc) were extremely attentive and responsive to requests as well as keeping the place extremely well clean and cleared.

I love carbs...Carbs with carbs and a side of carbs.  They serve warm syrup with their pancakes (yum!) and their bread is just amazing.  

The ""side of pancakes"" is plenty big for a meal and they are always consistent, fluffy, and tasty.  

They offer both a dark roast and a house roast for coffee and all the powdery loveliness (cinnamon, nutmeg, cocoa) to top it off just right.

Today, before returning to the land of freeways and smog and eternal sunshine(well, the other land of that anyway) we enjoyed their peppermint hot chocolate. I would highly recommend that you run on it and have this frothy goodness before the holiday season ends!",1
"The best part about Logan's is the rolls - and I don't mind that you do not need to add butter because it is already dripping with butter. YUM! I can taste a hint of beer in the roll as well...or it could just be yeast..or wishful thinking. I am trying to be healthier, so I went with the salad and water. The anything-and-everything salad does have some good items included - craisins, pecans, egg, grilled chicken and a good balsamic vinaigrette dressing...but still it was a salad. Maybe I should have ordered the grilled streak salad...but the peanuts are a free appetizer and you can throw them on the floor. What fun! The sweet tea is outstanding and reminds me of my days in Atlanta.

Another review commented about the similarity between Logan's and Texas Roadhouse. They are very similar, but I wouldn't say Logan's is a knock off. Plus Logan's was started in 1991 to Texas Roadhouse's 1993, so perhaps they are the ones being imitated?

Come in for a sweet tea, free peanuts and the excellent rolls. The rest is about your average steakhouse. Two salads, one tea and a water - $22.",1
Who doesn't like a good carne asada burrito? No one doesn't that's who. It's rudunk,1
"I am so glad I found this nursery! Not only is it a beautiful place but the employees are unbelievable, so helpful and knowledgeable. 

Needed to get my garden ready for planting and they helped with everything. The plants they have look great, not all wilted like some other places. 

Think this has become one of my weekend stops.",1
"Sorry, I am gonna get killed here... I am not that impressed.
I kept hearing about this place and it was so so at best. The food is sloppy and very expensive but has a decent taste
The place was also a little dirty looking..
Just a bunch of sandwiches and the pizza was a disaster, go there if you are into quirky places that charge a lot and are not the best.
The waitress seemed pre-occupied by what?? not us.",2
"I rarely disagree with the average yelp ratings... I tried Blue Adobe based on great reviews but was greatly disappointed.

I really can't find a redeeming quality about the night... I had their ""killer margarita"" which is a cheaper house margarita, it was lousy, i was a bartender for some time myself, there is no reason to make a margarita that bad, you can do better, especially here in AZ we are a mecca of citrus!

The bean and cheese dip appetizer was uninspired, nothing special... I saw lobster tamales on the menu and couldn't get past them, i could not think of a way that someone could make a tamale with lobster and make it well, so i was really excited to see how they do it... poorly was how they did it, lobster was over cooked there was very little of it in the tamale and the biggest issue was exactly what i thought it would be, the corn masa just overpowered the little lobster that was in the tamale... they could have put imitation crab in there and saved them self a bunch of money and it would taste the same... it just doesn't work! There was a raspberry chipotle sauce on the side that was very good, but again this too took away from the whole point of the dish: the lobster.  

tried a chimmichunga, whatever, not special.  

service was no good, our waitress was very frantic, I felt like i was a burden or a bother to her (and no, I'm not. I've spent years in food service, makes you very kind to your server)

It seems like snow birds keep this place in business, the restaurant was full of them... they must forget what their experience was like over the summers...",2
"I went today to meet my daughter for lunch.  We are both big sushi enthusiasts.  The interior and atmosphere was beautiful.  Well appointed.
The service was excellent.  We ordered edamame, was good...nothing to rave about.  Not much you can do to mess that up.  Drinks were well poured but exspensive for what you got.  Ordered five different sushi rolls.
All five were bland, not much flavor and stale.  The fish was not fresh.
Paid $12 for a soft shell crap roll and it tasted days old.  Will not go back.
Did here they have good pizza and a happy hour at three.  My daughter says to give it another try.  We'll see... I'll let you know if I do.",2
Good place to chill with a drink somewhere lowly lit and good live music. All the bartenders are really nice and that's always RAD:),1

"just wanted to chime in & say that this place is so vegetarian-UN-friendly it's not even funny. I was dragged here with family & ended up ordering a chile relleno, which was just about the only meatless item on the menu, short of a fucking cheese crisp.

it wasn't terrible, but this place is really just all kinds of lame. service was mediocre, food was mediocre. with as many awesome & authentic mexican restaurants as there are in the valley, there's no reason on earth to come back, except MAYBE to try a mango margarita.",2
Just called at 9:45 to ask when they were open until. Woman said they were already closed but website says open until 10 pm. Really?? Obviously don't care about patronage...mexican is a dime a dozen in the new NEW Mexico...no thanks. Next!,2
"It's a freeway.

Traffic sucks near downtown but the views are nice through Dreamy Draw.

Super friendly staff and smoothies come out so fast...delicious too!,1
"Oh, this was not good. Food not tasty. Overpriced not tasty food. If you're going to pay for a crab benedict, it should remotely taste like crab. And not be cold. Too busy, too long of a wait, too hungry to change. Other items tasted at our table did not receive much better feedback. I can't recall what others ate. In fact, there wasn't much worth remembering.",2
"This place really hits the spot.  It's everything a hamburger place should be and nothing it shouldn't.  Their burgers are good-sized and delicious.  I attribute their scrumptiousness to the bread in the buns, but their meat is phenomenal as well; add some cheese and green chiles, and it's like a bunch of awesome ingredients decided to get together to take part in creating one of the best burgers in town with a little help from the grill.  The fries are effing good too.

The pitchers of beer are cheap and cold, and if you want to feed your inner hipster they also have bottles of PBR and cans of Schlitz.  Not a lot to feast the eyes on - the place has a real old-school ""bar"" feel - but the food compensates for what it may lack in elegance.",1
"Not impressed. Tried them for the first time ordering takeout. Quick delivery, but the pizza and garlic knots were not cooked completely. Raw dough was not very appetizing.  I called the manager to let them know, he offered to give me credit, but a better solution would have been to cook another pizza and deliver it again.  Not sure if we'll order from them again.",2
"This particular Budget Lodge is a hidden no-frills gem. We spent a single night here after a long day's travel. Two story motel with gated outer access stairway, balconies to second story rooms, two inner stairwells (carpeted). No elevator, which is a shame as we had rather a lot of bags to bring inside. Still, a very clean, comfortable room.

Ladies, you will appreciate the bathrooms. While the towels are not spa-quality, the room had a pleasant palette (yellow, white, chrome and beige) and one of the best showerheads I've had the pleasure to use in a motel. High enough to adjust and not hit my head (I'm just shy of six feet). Excellent water pressure. 

Our balcony overlooked the alleyway and nearby buildings but the rate, the sleeping accomodations and the overall comfortable feeling surpassed any minor discomforts. 

I'd stay here again.",1
"Foot Locker is home to the largest selection of athletic shoes in the mall but the pricing could be better.  Their inventory also includes a dozen or so Foot Locker exclusives like several Nike Air Max 95 colorways.  

Foot Locker sweats, hoodies, and other athletic gear are generally durable, fit well, and priced well.  The Chandler store also places some focus on team athletic apparel and miscellaneous sports accessories.  

The sales aren't that great.  I saw a pair of Jordan CMFT's in the white/gray/black colorway selling for $80.  I bought the same pair at a Nike Outlet in New Jersey in July for $50.  What's up with that?

I can't call it...",0
"I really wish that I lived closer to one of the Crackers locations, because their breakfast menu rocks! After a field trip to IKEA with my mom and sister we decided to grab a bite to eat, I knew that Crackers had recently opened nearby, so we stopped by. The inside is very cute, feels like you are in someones country home. The menu has a huge variety of breakfast dishes, sandwiches, salads and soups. On weekends, they serve breakfast all day! 

I got the Carnitas breakfast skillet, and let me just say, they seriously have some of the best carnitas in town, no joke! The pork was so tender; covered with jack cheese on a bed of potatoes, heaven! My sister got the BLT, and they were not skimpy on the bacon! I have had some of their soups before, and let's just say, the Cream of Spinach & Artichoke is like heaven in a bowl! So rich, and creamy, it is like eating dip without the chips! 

They are only open until 2:00, but it is great spot to grab a bite to eat for breakfast or lunch!",1
"So, I've been trying to check this place out for awhile. I love b-fast, almost as much as staying up late and sleeping in, so it did take me awhile to check it out before they closed at two (my average wake up time). In fact I arrived right at two, which having been a server, I know sucks. Our server Marci was super nice and welcomed us in anyway, without even one look of contempt, which I know is what I would have delivered had I been serving a table at closing time. The food was delicious, and it being a ""fuck it"" day, ordered bacon wholeheartedly. It was the most delicious, thick cut bacon I've had. And the rest of the meal was delicious and reasonably priced. Next time I'm awake early (or up late) I'll be back.",1
"Clean, fast, fairly cheap.  I had the Orange chicken and it was good. Liked the brown rice option.   I enjoyed this $6.19 meal much more than the lame sandwich/soup I had at Great Grains yesterday and that cost me $12.25,  I'll be back to Tott's.",1
"I went for lunch with a large group and the place was pleasantly empty. The decor is very modern and has a comfortable lounge style.

The chips and salsa are a great starter. You get three tasty kinds of salsa: brown, red, and pico de gallo. The tortilla chips are fried perfectly. They are extremely light and crispy.

I tried the steak tostadas. The meat had a food flavor and the tortillas were nice and crunchy. The red jalapeño and fresh cilantro on top brought excitement to each bite. 

The dishes are small, but they are are also inexpensive at $6-10 each. Along with the chips and salsa, I got plenty of food, so portion sizes are only an issue for big eaters. It seems like a great place to share several dishes between everyone. 

I would definately go back for the food, but I wonder if this place becomes a standing-room only drunk fest when it gets busier and later in the evening (if so, no thanks).",1
"So I'm torn on how to rate this place star-wise because honestly, there were a few things that were 10 stars and there were a few things that were 1 star. So let me break it down for you. We walked in to this cool little spot on the Sunday before Memorial Day and it was about half full. It looked like it was VERY groovy but I seriously had to use my phone to walk around because it was SO dark. We sat at the bar and not one of the bartenders addressed us for like 15 minutes. Maybe they couldn't see us? Anyhoo the wine list is interesting and I was having a hard time choosing something. The one bartender that finally waited on us had NO personality. I asked for a taste of a few things they had by the glass. They sounded very interesting but I had never heard of quite a few of them and I pride myself on knowing my wine. The first one I tried was a syrah blend that had something to do with chocolate and it was just that...too chocolatey. My friend ordered a glass of the Justin Cabernet which is always a safe bet. I then asked for the Tannat they had by the glass. It was awful. It taste like it had been opened for days. I told our personality challenged bartender and he went and tattled on us to maybe the manager? The manager then came over and was pleasant if a bit condescending at first. He said ""well have you ever had a Tannat? and I said ""actually, all the time, I know what they're about and that is no Tannat"" he then did agree with me and said ""just tell me what you're looking for"" I told him I wanted a Cabernet Franc or Grenache which they didn't have either by the glass. He ended up pouring me something that really was delicious. He definitely redeemed the evening because he was professional and helpful. We then ordered the flatbread with pesto and a few different cheeses and it was seriously one of the better flatbreads I've ever had. They had two guys playing live music and they were very good. So my break down is:
Atmosphere - 4
Attitude - 1 except for the knowledgeable bartender, he gets a 10
Flatbread - 10
QPR - 10...for those non-winey's this is quality price ratio",0
"I really try to like Old Town Scottsdale - and if you look past all the God-Awful tourist traps it is actually quite a nice place with a number of top notch dining options - but in the end you can only walk by so many mass-produced ""native"" jewelry shops with ""Bargains"" before it all starts blending together.  Parking is generally a travesty but can be found if you're willing to wait it out and the public art is a nice touch.  For my dollar - go, grab a spot, and kill some time at Cartel, grab some local foods at Bodega, and maybe consider a bite at one of the locally owned restaurants like FnB or Praying Monk, and skip any place with turquoise jewelry in the window while focusing on the galleries that don't quite seem to fit the 'theme.'",0
"Last night was my first adult play experience. I have been to the theater to see the Nutcracker when I was a kid and I saw the Lion King in New York when I was a kid as well. I remember them being fun, but that's about the extent of my memories of the theater. There happened to be a groupon for the play ""The Mystery of Irma Vep"" that my mom purchased for the four of us (mom, myself, husband, sister) to attend. 

We got there a bit early after dinner and walked around the theater looking at the art that was up around the building. There were places you could grab a drink and relax before the show. At our call time we went in and found our seats. We were up on the balcony in the fifth row pretty much right in the center. We had really good seats. The only thing about this theater that made me uncomfortable and keeps it from attaining that fifth star were first of all the seats. The backs were extremely straight and having a back condition it makes sitting up that straight difficult for long periods of time. The second thing that was a bit uncomfortable was the temperature of the theater. It was a bit warmer than I would have liked. I left coated in a film of sweat. Not pleasant. I was nervous I wasn't dressed appropriately having never been to the theater before, I went in jeans and a t-shirt, but I am glad now that I did because it would have been much more uncomfortable in one of my nice silk dresses than in jeans. 

However the show was hilarious. The part that made it for me was when one of the characters started singing the Rebecca Black ""Friday"" song. Classic! Most of the people in the theater didn't get the reference so there were only a few pockets of young people laughing when it happened. But I found it to be a nice touch and after a play full of references I didn't get, I liked that there was something for us young folk thrown in. The rest of the show was funny, and I am glad that I got to experience it. 

After coming here I am interested in becoming more active in plays and am looking into seeing a ballet soon. All of us really enjoyed this, and I was surprised my husband liked this as much as he did. A good time had by all!",1
"The service at this location was great, until one of the servers managed to incorporate throwing up in into a conversation while I was nursing a hangover. Never a good idea to talk throwing up to a customer that is eating.duh!! This conversation led to more inappropriate words from the employee until he finally left....grrrrr!!!

Had the biscuits& gravy special ( $10.95 ), no bueno. I like my gravy simple...just some gravy with a little sausage running through,thats it. Can't stand it when there is onions, peppers, celery, carrot...yuck!! And they served those generic potatoes that are big flavorless cubes that they put in the deep fryer. Should have just had the chicken and waffle, lesson learned.",2

"Great Mexican food. 
Authentic street tacos plus a full menu of tasty dishes. 
Halibut tacos remind me of Ensenada
Michelada with Pacifico beer is a perfect beverage for any dish.",1
"Two trends that need to end.  ASAP.  Really, ahorita:

1.  Bacon mixed with everything under the sun.  Bacon doesn't need an accompaniment, it's amazing all on its own.  No more bacon donuts.  Please, for the love.

2.  Overuse of truffle oil.  Dumping truffle oil on a dish does not make it gourmet.  Please stop.  For real.

Culinary Dropout is guilty of succumbing to these two trends.  That being said, the service and atmosphere make it forgivable.  Our server and the manager were hyper aware of how long we'd been waiting.  Even though it was not that big of a deal to us, it was nice to know they cared.

They mean well when it comes to cocktails, but they were a little lightweight for me, relying heavily on simple syrup and mixers to dumb down the alcohol.  Their beer list made up for it, though.  I've never had a stout in a can, but they managed to find the brewery that pulled it off.

Yeah, my ricotta gnocchi was drenched in truffle oil, but the sausage and mushrooms made it actually a pretty good dish.  And the beets were fresh and delicious.

I liked it, I'm not gonna lie, but I wish they'd stop falling prey to the trends and branch out a bit.  Culinary Dropout, you're better than that.",1
"Went for my birthday and anniversary, and I was pleased by both the service and the food.  The waiter let me try a  piece of Prime Rib, since I'd never had it before (I know, what have I been missing?!?!), so kudos for going out of his way.

Another nice touch was the manager personally coming over to introduce herself and ask about our experience. 

Overall the service was great, and the food, while tasty, wasn't spectacular or terribly distinguished.  I probably wouldn't come here too often, mainly due to price, unless I have more birthday coupons.",1
"Not impressed. Start with the service. Not professional. It seemed as though the wait staff was clueless as to the table numbers. We were given the wrong table's order twice. 

Second, the food was conceptually a mess. No clear theme or flavor profiles. The food was heavy, greasy and took forever to arrive. None of the dishes were memorable. 

Third, the wine selection seemed to be lacking. And, the sommelier didn't know where the wine was from she was serving. Not impressed.",2
"If I could only eat at one place for the rest of my life, it would have to be at FnB. This is ultimate comfort food for me - with the bulk of the menu highlighting local in-season organic vegetables from McClendon and other local farms. Charleen prepares dishes that pay the ultimate homage to the vegetable and the farmer with perfect seasoning, contrast, balance and temperatures. 

Beyond vegetables, the housemade burrata was light as a cloud and shrimp grilled to perfection on the mesquite. Dishes at FnB are simple but often the simplest dishes are the hardest to get right as there is nothing to hide behind - ingredients have to be fresh and of the highest quality and execution must be perfect. Charleen and her crew strike it out of the park almost every time.

Service is professional, attentive and friendly. Pavle and his team make you feel right at home, which is the other reason why I would happily eat here everyday.",1
Home sweet home love it ...only wish is more hot water for showers other than that it's a great place to live,1
"Cevapi and Burek oh my!! Plus I got to hang with my fabulous friend Amra! Score! We wanted something extra good to eat after finishing our Mud Factor race on Saturday and lord knows I have been craving some Cevapi so off we went to Euro Bakery. It was already bookmarked as a place I wanted to try so this was a win, win in my book. 

Everything is made fresh to order and once you walk in, you can smell the fresh baked bread that they have made throughout the day. There is also a mini grocery store for you to buy items as well.  My Cevapi (little beef sausages with fresh bread, onions and a  sour cream like dip) came out piping hot and piled high. My friends Burek was huge (hmm not sure hot to explain so you will have to look that one up) and we both dived in like it was the last meals we would ever have.

Will I come back? Hmm heck yes, but alas this treat can only be saved for when I burn off and absurd amount of calories so that I can indulge and not feel guilty at all.  Hmm Cevapi and Burek = one VERY happy woman!",1
"How can I not show yelp love for the original fro yo shop that kept my addiction fulfilled in the early days of the fro yo phenomenon? Yes, that is what Golden Spoon is to me. 

When I first moved to Phoenix from college, I was coming from an area that was overloaded with frozen yogurt shops for the college girls who shared my love of the frozen treat. Unfortunately, Phoenix hadn't quite yet jumped on the bandwagon and so the only choice was Golden Spoon. To make matters worse, the only locations were north on Shea or South in Awatukee. So, since I was living in Old Town, the Shea location was typically my choice. 

I can say that I added several miles on my car very willingly to treat my taste buds to Golden Spoon. Yes, it was the closest shop to me but it's also creamy and completely delicious. The frozen yogurt is served by staff and comes in different sizes. You can choose from multiple toppings and it's just your ""old fashioned"" frozen yogurt shop. I'm using old fashioned very loosely in this sense, since frozen yogurt is anything but old fashioned, but with the self-serf trend, Golden Spoon is ""old fashioned"" compared to that. 

I don't visit Golden Spoon as often as I'd like anymore because it is still a bit of a drive, but anytime I'm in the area, I know just exactly where to stop for a sweet frozen treat!",1
"I have a fond place in my heart for this establishment

I've been covering my all white meat rice bowls in their sticky spicy teriyaki sauce for 10+ years

I've lived all over the world

I always crave three things when I'm not living in Phoenix (or the USA)
1.  Skim Milk
2.  Mexican food
3.  Tokyo Express

Now pay attention

If you like spicy food and teriyaki sauce, here's what you should order

An all white spicy chicken teriyaki bowl
5 extra sides of spicy sauce
A small salad
2 extra sides of salad dressing

Ok, so I REALLY like sauce.  Really.

This place makes me want to cry I love it so much.",1
"Carly's is a cute little restaurant with a fun atmosphere.  My friends and I started off with the Feta Rosa and it was a great start!  Amazingly delicious- I even added some to my sandwich because I couldn't get enough!  I had the pear sandwich with orzo salad as my side and loved every bite!  Yummy pear, pruschetto, and cheese perfection!

Carly's is definitely worth checking out.  It has great food and a great atmosphere to boot!",1
Amazing place wish i lived in Phx so i could have this EVERYDAY!,1
"I used to live off this place. They cut their meats and cheeses fresh like a real deli, so already it kicks the shit out of Subway, Quiznos, and every other fast food deli chain that offers up pre-packaged meats. Their bread and cookies are fresh as well. For some reason, this location has better tasting food than any other Port-o-Subs I've been to. Don't know why.

There's always a long line at lunch, but it moves fast. There's some good people watching to be done here - cops eat here, firemen eat here, doctors and nurses eat here, and you also get the entire spectrum of downtown Scottsdale folk... sometimes you would think you arrived at a costume party or they are filming a new Village People video. I don't know what it is and I don't know that it matters either, but good looking people eat here. Whatever you want to make of that... 

Most of the people that work here are really nice and competent. They keep this place pretty clean as well. Once I noticed some fruit flies buzzing around by the soda machine and was told they sometimes come with the fresh fruit they get for the smoothies (which are fantastic). Outside of that, I can't complain about this sub shop and I eat here all the time... it's almost just about as good as a non-chain place.",1
"This place is such a delightful treat. Not only is the Barrio Cafe in what some Phoenicians would called the actual barrio, but it's non-descript on the outside and purely magical within. Not terribly difficult you keep your eyes peeled, Barrio Cafe is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Arizona and is a must try for any Phoenix local. 

You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu, although their seafood offerings are my least favorites. I am in love with their conchita pibil, which is their slow-roasted pork and they have the best made-at-the-table guacamole in all of Phoenix. Their food is the kind of special occasion dinner that you and all your guests will be savoring every morsel, but save room for one of their delectable desserts! I'm a fan of their flan, in particular. 

Service is spot on and it's usually pretty packed, so come as early as you can or face a semi-long wait at the bar. Don't worry though, they've got great margaritas. This is the place Tempe's Mucho Gusto wished it could be some day. But it probably won't.",1
"We stayed at the Sheraton downtown and Matt's was a short walk.  Definitely worth the walk, and it helped to justify eating such a large breakfast.  There is probably something there that is not very good, but we did not find it.  When you get there, make sure you check in with the person running the register",1
"Yeah it was good. My wife & I went with 2 other foodie couples, who are good friends, for our monthly ""side dish"" function.  The food was all fantastic.  All 5 of the other people in our group were drinking martinis, which they all said were very tasty as well, but at $12-$16 per, I'm a little put off.  I'm more of a beer guy anyway, so I had a couple of craft-brews that are not available everywhere, and then settled on a Firestone DBA -- a very very tasty beer -- and had several of those.  Great food, great booze, club music atmosphere is pretty cool. Outdoor area is excellent. Felt like an idiot when I had to ask where the mens room was only to turn around and find that the huge wall of a door was right behind me and said ""he"" in huge letters on the bottom of the door.  Oh and then (6 or 7 strong beers into the evening) I found that the mirror next to the (only) urinal in the mens room misled me into believing there was a second urinal, which I tried unsuccessfully to walk to.  Why is that guy walking directly toward me?  Oh, it's me.  In the mirror. Dumbass.  So then (after relieving myself in the actual urinal) I go back out to the table to tell the story about trying to use the urinal in the mens room that doens't exist, and somebody else says ""yeah the same fucking thing happened to me too!"" so I don't feel like such a dumbass anymore.  Fun night.",1
"¡CASH ONLY! But so worth it.

I have been  a regular at this place for the past 10 years. I am Mexican and for me this is the most authentic ""Cenaduría"" in Phoenix. 

The food is authentic. They use the white Mexican cheese is used in Mexico. In Mexico cheddar cheese is not used on top of tacos or tostadas. Prices are very affordable. The ladies that take your order at the front desk had been there for at least 10 years and are very kind. 

Restrooms are always clean and this is so important to me. If a restaurant does not have the time to maintain its restrooms clean then I can not trust them in the food being clean.

The cons......BRING CASH! no credit cards are accepted. Also, they do not have the best control over flies. I always have a fly somewhere around my table. I think it has to be with no AC. They have some kind of cooler and fans. And they can have the Tv and the jukebox playing at the same time which is annoying. 

The good news is that you can always take the food out.

¡Excellent food!",1
"The food is moderately priced and good, but the drinks are outrageously Scottsdale expensive.  I'll admit that they key lime martini was very delicious.  The Hell's Fire chips and Asian shrimp were perfect, and I would definitely recommend the food.  The lighting, more like a glow than a light, was quite awesome.  Service was pretty slow but professional.  The dj was great!  No one was wearing jeans, but there was a mixed crowd of some people in their 40's and many in their late 20's or early 30's.",0
I was not impressed. The food was bad & expensive. The wait is ridiculous. Don't go.,2
"I had a great time at The Roosevelt. The lovely duo of Megan and Gretel took care of me with good food and drink and everybody I met there was really quite friendly. I liked the almost too many choices of beers on tap, including the current rotating pick: Summer Solstice from Anderson Valley. (I'm told that brew isn't widely available on tap in the phoenix area.)

everybody say it together now: get the pretzel. but be careful it is piping hot, you may want to ask for a knife and fork if you want to eat it immediately. 

my entire life I've never had a tomato soup I liked until I had their grilled cheese and tomato soup. the soup was great! but the cheese sandwich could have been better.

one thing to be aware of is they serve mostly beer and wine, with a ginger ale and a root beer. oh, and water. so don't ask for a martini, cola, or other bar favorite.",1
"This Chipotle Rocks!  
Today, I express my joy
In the haiku form!

Perfect fast food joint;
Fresh, delicious, quick and kind.
The price is right, too!

Burritos galore;
In a tortilla or bowl.
But wait, there is more!

Three steak tacos, please!
Or grilled veggie fajitas?
Oh sweet perfection.

A simple menu,
Yet so many decisions.
How can you go wrong?

Answer:  You cannot!  
Order now, you won't regret,
This Chipotle Rocks!",1
"Alright, went back last night, felt bad because we were the late nighters, and everything was perfect.  The pizza, the salads and the wine were all so well done.  And what finally brought me to five stars was the crepe with Nuteila and Mascarpone.  OMG amazing.  I'm currently craving it the day after.  Totally beats out the crepe with nutella and banana that I also love...",1
"I'm not going to lie - I indulged in fantasies about Howard Roark during the course of my 90-minute Insights tour. His spirit and convictions were brought to life by FLW and being in this incredible complex where he lived, worked and taught was indescribably cool.  The tour takes you around the property and through many of the rooms, restored to various periods of Frank's life. I was a bit dismayed at the disrepair some of the rooms are in, so I spent money in the gift shop hoping it will go to repairing some sad looking chairs and windowpanes.  
Overall, the tour guides are genius at describing and making you feel like you're seeing things through FLW's eyes with his vision on architecture and lifestyle.  This is not to be missed!",1
"Preface: I'm being nice
3 stars is an OK rating and I don't want my opinions to skew the rating scale but a 2.5 star option if available would be welcome, again I'm being nice.

This place is terrible. (I might be exaggerating)  I have heard horrible stories about the brewery in Tucson, how the beer is fine but the food is absolute crap.  I figured hey they are moving to Scottsdale in an area with an insane amount of delicious dining establishments, they have to of retooled that menu ... they didn't.  The beer honestly is good not great 4peaks IMO is at least 2x better (again being nice) but I respect a local presence and craft beer so I cant knock them for trying and building a successful brand.

That being said the food is really nothing special at all, they offer pairings like mac and cheese pizza (too gross to try) to things like salmon and steak (too fancy for here).  I tried a burger, usually safe with a mix of sweet potato and regular fries.  I also had the monkey shine which has the highest alcohol content (something I am supportive of) and even after that beer the food disappointed (how can that be?!).  It wasn't that the burger was horrible but it just wasn't anything special, it was bland and I got the western that had tons of stuff on it.   The biggest problem was the fries which ironically seemed to come out of the frozen food section of a local Frys Food and Drug (not even a signature, Kroger brand - house brand aka the worst).  A friend joining me had the wings, the wings were actually pretty good but they were wings and wings are gonna be good in a place like this especially after some beer so I feel that we should take that for what its worth.

With mediocre food at best and OK beer I don't see any reason to go here over 4 peaks.

Improve your menu and I'll give you another shot. :)",0
"I really like this place. However it does suck time like no other place.

Somehow evertime you are there for over 2 hrs?

I usually try on 60 items to get 1 that fits well, and cry a half dozen times about being fat :(

Then I cruise the little kids clothes because the mens clothes are to large for me and the womens are cut weird.

One of my boobs is like a 3rd the size of the other so its soo hard to find clothes that dont make me look like a cancer survivor.

Anyway, good finds here. Try the clothes on even if it says the size is smaller than you wear. A lot of times it says one size but is really another.
My girlfriend bought 200.00 jeans for 20.00 a piece because it said they were a 24 when they were really a 27.


P.S. anyone know where to find some dress vests?

The womens ones are too short and make me look like I have flowing love handles and the mens vests are to big in the shoulders and ribs.

I think I should try maybe a kids vest? thoughts?",1
This place was great... Well as great as a doctors visit can be.  They called us (my son was the patient)  back within 5 minutes and immediately saw a doctor.  She was kind and took her time - asked a lot of questions and did not hastily diagnose and fully explained to us what was going on with my son's health.,1
"I had to drop it down to 2 stars.  The food was the same quality, but they do not bring out big bowls of white and brown rice anymore.  They brought out 5 small bowls of rice when there are 7 of us.  Are we suppose to share or have our individual bowls?  

We had our usuals:
2 chicken fried rice - ok
2 mongolian beef - good
2 chicken chow mein - good
2 crispy honey chicken - good
1 orange peel chicken - meh...
1 spicy chicken - too spicy for me, but the group said it was good

Main reason for the 2 stars was the service SUCKED!  We had to literally get our servers attention for anything (refills, more rice, togo boxes, etc.).  We waited 15 mins for our server to pick up the check, he never showed!  So we handed it off to other server and asked if she can help us.  He came back to the table only the times we can grab he attention.  We were always out of drinks.  I have not had that BAD of a service in a long time.  I will not come back on my own, but if the family wants to then they can drag me along (kicking and screaming).",2
"Thought Saturday night would be busy at 6:00 PM, but to our surprise it was just getting started. We don't like to go there too often because it seems that a lot of older folks go there, not that I'm a ""spring chicken"".

The waiter was efficient, he never told us his name but memorized our order. He made sure we had our drink glasses filled at all times.

When he brought out the bread, it was only three pieces of different types: roll, carrot bread and another type. We had to ask for another order.

My daughter had the Chicken Pot Pie which had chunks of chicken but the sad part, the crust was only on the top, which was golden brown. To her it was OKAY. My wife had the petite sirloin steak which came with a salad and asparagus. She ordered it medium rare and it was a little too pink, but still eatable. My order was the Lamb Shank on top of mashed potatoes and asparagus. Love asparagus!! The lamb was okay and portion was just right. The sauce that was poured over the lamb was like beef stew gravy with carrots and celery. The sauce was a bit salty for me but bearable. If you looked at the lamb shank you would mistaken it for a turkey drumstick.",0
"The absolute worse service I've encountered. My boyfriend, son and I sat at a tepan table, we were ignored for a good 15-20 minutes until my boyfriend had to ask the manager to please have someone get us something to drink. Once we had our drinks, it took another 20 minutes to order our food. By that time, another family sat at our table. My son & boyfriend ordered a meal from the tepan menu, I had sushi. Everyone on that table got their meal and I still didn't get my sushi. I asked the server to please bring it and she brought someone else's order, I had to wait another 20 minutes for my sushi. The family on our table were so upset for us as well. 

The food is excellent, the service is so poor I am disappointed. I advise anyone who comes here to sit at the sushi bar and deal with the Chefs, they are great. I talked to the owner and she was just as bad as the servers. 

I then gave it another try. I met my girlfriends there. We had dinner, spent over $200. We then moved over to the bar area and were completely forgotten about. We asked the manager/owner to please have someone come take care of us and we were told that they were concerned because we were drinking and had kids with us. One of my girlfriends had her kids but she was not drinking. I was offended that she tried to cover up the poor service with her so-called concern. 

Again, food is great service is lousy. I am so disappointed and will not go back. I will look elsewhere for my Caliente Rolls. I hear Blu at the Wigwam is really good and servers are hospitable.",2
"I have been saving my 100th review for my favorite restaurant of all time. 

We found Thai Basil over a year ago now and have been loyal customers, going at least once a week and sometimes more than that, since last July. Everyone who works here is super friendly, and they know us now and know what we like to order by heart. We just walk in now and they see us and say ""Spicy noodle, tofu, hot, right?"" Its pretty great having a place that knows my regular order. I have tried most of the menu items. The garlic eggplant is also pretty great. The thai basil is also amazing. I have generally liked everything I have had here except the curry. I never have had a good curry experience. Both of the times I ordered it I ended up with long black hairs in it (which they quickly replaced with a new order) but I just wasn't a fan. Maybe it's because of the coconut milk and it makes it too sweet. 

The spring rolls are also the best here out of every spring roll I have had anywhere. 

Before I went vegan again last year we also got the fried banana ice cream pretty often. That is pretty amazing. If you eat dairy, you have to try it at least once. 

Thai Basil is one of our regular spots to eat out, and we hope its here to stay for many more years to come. I don't know what I would do without my spicy noodles!!!",1
"Rude, rude, rude. I will *never* go back to this place. I don't normally carry cash and when I went to pick up my son's pants for his recital that night, I was in a little bit of a jam (they only take cash or checks). When I suggested they might put this on the claim ticket, or at least mention it when people drop off their clothes, the owner pointed to an itty bitty sign and told me ""we have signs everywhere."" The owner was hostile and argumentative and just didn't care about what I had to say. Then he hovered over me while my son tried his pants on, like I was going to steal something (the place is TINY). I went to an ATM and pulled out cash, it wasn't that big of a deal, but this place has no customer service skills whatsoever. I won't ever go there again. Steer clear.",2
"My daughter's 128i BMW was horribly keyed this summer and we found Harvil's through State Farm Insurance. Fred Harvil was very friendly and helpful to work with and we really appreciated his service. She dropped her car off on Monday I believe and she had the car back by Friday. His rates were very good and ended up being lower than we had expected, and what we liked about him is that he was very honest. My daughter had accidentally backed her car into a pole earlier that summer and hadn't gotten it fixed because she kept getting quoted around $500 and couldn't do that, but because Harvil was already going to fix the rest of the car he only charged her $100 to repair the back bumper which was really nice. He also set us up with a rental car for her through Hertz that she was able to leave there at the shop and have them pick up which was great and convenient. 

All in all, Fred Harvil was very pleasant to work with, timely, and left her car looking like new. Definitely recommend!",1
"Place is avg.  Sushi was good but the red sangria saki was bad. Service was sporadic and we had a one plate that they forgot to put the sauce on, and another couple plates they tried to give us which we did not order.   I would try to find another place.",2
"We went there yesterday a I enjoyed it. The atmosphere was fantastic, because they had a tv, plus they have a lot of pictures of Man V. Food, when Adam Richman came here. The service is good, because they waited for us to order, and were very patient.   I ordered the Jewish Slider like Adam did, but I didn't take the challenge. 1 order of Jewish SIiders are 3 sliders. The sliders were awesome. The meat was tender and really juicy. The cheese didn't really make a difference, it just added a little flavor, but the bun soft and chewy, and buttery which tasted like pancakes without syrup, and it was fresh. The potato pancakes put the lid on the jar. The potato pancakes aren't just a creative idea, it was very crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. There are 3 reasons why this isn't a normal slider. Reason number one is the Potato Pancakes, reason number two is the meat isn't a patty, and grinded beef that made that slider interesting. Reason number three is that the cheese is melted. REALLY melted. I will go again, because the sliders are amazing.",1
"This is one of the only places in Phoenix that carries legitimate book binding supplies like book cloth and all sorts of decorative binding papers (unlike the decorative kind for scrapbooking). I love that I can order online, and then they will call me when my order is ready and I can just head on down to Tempe to pick my stuff up.

While I haven't taken any of their classes, they look pretty awesome. I have had experiences with old letter press techniques, and this place offers classes in it. I think I'm going to have to sign up!",1
"My wife and I were having a lousy day and we needed somewhere to eat. We happened to drive past Stax and decided to give it a try. Once we sat down, our moods immediately improved. Our waiter was friendly, funny and attentive, without being overbearing or annoying. I was happy to see a decent selection of beers with a healthy dose of local brews. I immediately ordered an Oak Creek Nut Brown.

Our waiter quickly brought our drinks and glasses of water with cucumber slices. The cucumber added a nice cooling touch on a hot summer day.

We ordered the sweet potato fries and I ordered a seafood burger, which on that particular day was shrimp. The sweet potato fries were excellent, fried just right and lightly seasoned with kosher salt. Even without the homemade ketchup, the fries were a delight.

My burger was tasty, with the shrimp lightly breaded and seasoned with a kicky teriyaki sauce and served on the bun with lettuce and thin strips of carrots. Also, the bun was very soft and tasty.

The only issue with Stax is the price. The burgers are more like tapas, in that they're small (3 oz). But, each burger ranges from $4 to $7, depending on the type of meat. A hungry person could easily eat three burgers, so plan to spend a decent amount of money if you want a large meal here.

Overall, a fun place to grab a lighter bite to eat.",1
"I am a fan of taco stands in general, but....
This location consistently ruins my beloved bacon, potato, egg and cheese breakfast burrito.  Every now and then they get it just right, but most of the time there's something missing from it.  The bacon is frequently burned to a crisp, and the eggs...OH the poor eggs.  They are browned beyond all recognition and sometimes just a thin layer of bubbly burned stuff.",2
"I'm not sure why it has taken me so long to actually go inside Go-Kat-Go, but I finally did and loved it!  This store is filled with all sorts of great retro Hawaiian treasures along with a plethora of other gems.  We've got locally designed clothing in one corner, awesome furniture in another, tons of handmade accessories in the middle and bunches of fun throughout!  It was really hard not to pick up everything in this store and buy it.  The owner was really nice and offered to hold our stuff while we shopped.  I ended up walking out of there with an awesome Dia de los Muertos pillow that looks amazing on my new couch plus a matching potholder/oven mitt set in a really cool pattern.  I will definitely be back, especially since my other mom's b-day is coming up and she loves this kind of stuff.",1
"I have been dying to go here since a coworker's spouse is one of the chefs. We finally went  last night  before the Symphony and it was a very good dining experience. The food came impossibly fast. The shrimp and Sausage Po Boy sliders were heavenly. The bread is this roll type of joy like break back east. Yum. You know the type of bread you can't find in AZ or west of the Rockies as Al Pacino would say-lol!They also served the bread basket with a veggie type of garnish if mixed with butter and put on the bread it had a very pleasing taste to it. Innovative menu- Lobster Potpie and Duck Quesadillas. HMMMMMM! Interesting. I had a side of Mac and cheese which is what I had heard about for so long and a Caprese Salad. My friend had divine Salmon. I am not a Salmon fan but i tasted it and it was yummers. My Ice tea was tasty and my friend had  a Basil Mojito that was mixed well. I don't like them usually because they are so strong mouthwashy tasting, but this had a nice blend to it. The restaurant decor is beautiful.We did not get desert but I want to go back and try those Seasalt sticks. All in all I loved going here. DT was packed last night due to Wrestle-Mania but we were in and out  in an hour at 5ish, so try that time to avoid crowds. Service was great despite other reviews. I know great service and I had it.",1
"Wow, servers were a bunch of stuck up b's in corset's... that's original. Didn't eat, but wanted to check out the crowd on a Friday night.  Bleh... typical NoSco crowd of gym jockeys in Affliction shirts two sizes too small... late 40's women with enough botox to look early 40's and a few lost 20 somethings stretching to pay $12 for a drink.  The cover band made it an easy decision to bail and salvage the night at Eddy V's with some great oysters and live jazz from actual musicians.",2
"I was excited to eat here after reading the reviews. Then I ate there and I was less excited. 

I was prepped for some hot spicy New Mexican food. That did not arrive on my plate. It was tasty for sure but I was lead to believe that I would experience the food I grew up with in New Mexico. I didn't. 

It is possible that my expectations were too much for this restaurant to handle.",2
"I really like this place!  I was surprised to see the other rating with one star.  I have been 3 times in the last 2 months- always for lunch and ordered off the menu.  The restaurant itself is clean and neat, and our food has always been fresh, hot and yes, ""simple""- but really good.  You don't feel overly full (take the rest to go) and it's not greasy or heavy.  Good stuff.",1
"I was super excited to find a place in Arizona that has vegetarian pho!

The service was just mediocre.  It met basic requirements without any friendliness.

Very cost effective= CHEAP.",1
"Eaten here a few times. Just finished lunch and had a great salad & sandwich. The salad I had was the spinach with poached egg, it was awesome. My taste is for savory, ""umami"", this was perfect with the egg bacon and light dressing. The chicken sandwich was good with basil and brie. Then the creme brulee with tahitian vanilla was great. Just a nice quaint place to sit outside and have a good lunch. One problem I have with Zinc Bistro is that they have Stella on tap, great right? But for $7! That's one for $7. Come on, maybe $4. I just bought 12 for $10 at Total Wine.",1
"Went to this location last week - was nervous to go because although I love waffles, and fried chicken, the idea of eating them together freaked me out.  But my husband is a huge fan, so I decided to suck it up.  I'm glad I did... Although I typically prefer my waffles a little crispier than LoLo's makes them, the flavor was to die for!!!  And who doesn't love some delicious fried chicken!  I know I do.... Try it!  You'll love it!",1
"If you are a beer snob, stay at home trying to make it yourself.  If you enjoy a decent local beer in an old chandler building with a nice atmosphere give this place a shot.  The owner used to be a brew-master at Four Peaks Brewery which is a local favorite in Tempe.  

I am not a fan of the over-the-top Hops that a lot of folks enjoy.  A few of the offerings here have a bit too much bite for me.  The red ale was my favorite until they changed the recipe and over did the bitterness.  Right now I get a Sun Devil Ale when I go in and it is pretty good.  They will bring you a taster if you ask and will explain the offerings to help you choose.    

The food is always good.  It is a bar so don't expect 5 star cuisine.  The fries are great and the sandwiches and salads are good as well.  I haven't been disappointed with a meal yet.  Even when busy service is decent.  Enjoy the beer, watch the game and let it all unfold.",1
"Excellent breakfast.  Portions were more than ample, service was attentive.  You could tell the place draws it's regulars, but it's a good option for visitors as well.  I had an egg sandwich on ciabatta bread, and my partner had pancakes.  We were both pleased.",1
"San Felipe's Cantina will always have a special place in my heart. I've been coming here since it opened, and I haven't been disappointed yet! Here's some of my favorite things about them:

Happy Hour - San Felipe's has one of the best happy hours in the valley. Their drinks and appetizers are half off from 4pm-7pm, and my bill for drinks and dinner with friends is typically $20-$30. You can't beat that!

Service - I usually sit up at the bar when I stop by, and they have some of the friendliest bartenders in town! They always make me feel at home when I stop by, and they're quick to serve me during the late-night hours. The managers are also really good about hanging out and chatting with the customers to make them feel special. It works!

Food and Drinks - My favorite drink at San Felipe's is probably the Mexican Iced Tea. It's a long island iced tea, but they use passion fruit vodka instead of the traditional unflavored vodka. As far as food goes, I REALLY like the baja chicken wrap, the sonoran chicken sandwich, and the steak burrito with green sauce. A quick tip - ANYTHING with the baja sauce is great :)

Overall, this place is a lot of fun, and I really like the laid back vibe. I'll definitely be back!",1
"VERY nice. The owner supports soldiers; we used a USO voucher here for a quick last-minute getaway before my husband deployed. The rooms are very clean and seem really updated. The staff is extremely nice and helpful, and the breakfast is pretty good. It's also RIGHT next to Ikea, can't go wrong there!",1
"Food was delicious, portions were great, and price was very reasonable! Highly recommend",1
"I love this place, saves me and my family some serious cash. I do agree with allot of the other reviewers on the meat and produce - my wife gets those from the store across the street. 

I also love the fact that they have a Sushi shop inside the store. Makes a great quick snack. The lady the works there will make almost anything you want. And, you can call in your ""order"" ahead if needed. She (or her son) have never let me down in quality and freshness of the Sushi.",1
"I absolutely love the food here! the service is good, the food is excellent and as far as the price goes..I can't complain. this is one of favorite places to eat.",1
"Found this place through Yelp and a Yelping buddy so there you have it...the power of Yelp because we absolutely LOVED this place.  Tucked into a neighborhood you have a very cozy, eclectic little joint.  From the start to the end we received extremely friendly service. We of course tried the foods suggested in previous reviews and by the server.  The pasta fries were unique, light and paired with great tasting sauces.  A definite dish you have to try.  We also tried the figs stuffed with chorizo.  Also very good & savory.  But the ABSOLUTE FAVORITE of the night were the chicken and waffles!  My gosh is this the dish to come to the Tuck Shop for.  The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.  The waffles were served with a butter that seemed to be whipped with possibly honey and the syrup was just the right sweet.  All the flavors seemed to work with just the right amount of sweet and savory.  The grilled fresh green beans were the perfect side.  I think I would get this dish over and over and over again.  Then I would go back and get it again.  
Great place we will frequent often.  

P.S. They make their own tonic.  Yep, their own tonic.  GREAT tasting!  Try it with the vodka they serve (haven't heard of it before but was very pleased).",1
"After long debate of where to have lunch, I am glad that I stopped into The Greek Pita.  

I had ordered the lamb gyro with everything except onions.  The gyro was loaded with lamb meat and toppings.  The pita was soft and fresh. The Tzatziki sauce  has a nice tang to it.  It tasted light, cool, and creamy.   The total cost was $5.74 + tax.  I left with a very happy belly.",1
"I have to give major kudos to our server here. We rolled up at 9p per the Yelp listing happy hour times. Come to find out that 9 is the weekday happy hour and Fri/Sat's happy hour doesn't start until 10. We we're okay with this but our server spoke to the manager without us even complaining or asking him to and honored the 9p happy hour because of the Yelp listing. 

Now to the food and drink. 
If you love cheese, their cheese menu was very large. We got several of the cheeses, the Tres Freres was my favorite (non-happy hour item though). The pork empanadas are a must and the happy hour drinks were very good as well. The strawberry sunset martini was very yummy. 

I'd say the happy hour items are where it's at overall. The food was great the drinks were good. Really given their menu and atmosphere I was really surprised that it wasn't more busy. It's kind of sad to see many of the Phoenix area restaurants kind of dead at 9pm on a Friday night. I'm guessing if it were located in Scottsdale that would be a different story.",1
"Great food and service. Normally a wait on the weekend, but what would you expect.",1
"I hate to find out that there was another location closer to where I was.  It doesn't matter because it was worth the trip.  I ordered pick up because I was by myself and wanted to a bit of exploring.  The place has a nice casual ambiance.  They also have an outdoor seating area.  I ordered the pad thai that comes with chicken and shrimp as a standard.  Since it was lunch time, it was part of the lunch menu that came with a choice of soup or salad.  I chose the soup, but was too stuffed to have it because I jumped right into the pad thai.  I ordered it medium spicy, and it was pretty spicy.  I can't imagine what hot would have tasted like.  Actually, I'm more curious of what it would have tasted like in a mild flavor.  The noodles were slightly overcooked, but still flavorful.  I also had the Thai Iced Tea here, and it was perfect for the weather and a great combination with the tangy pad thai flavor.  The prices are expensive compared to Chicago, but I hear it's typical for Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  My lunch speciai and drink costed me a little over $15.  I guess if you are craving it that bad like I was, you'll pay the price...",1
"Alison B. sums up all the great things about this unique store - and I would return if I was looking for a unique gift for any female friends of mine.

However, when I went in on a Sunday I was 1 of 4 women in the store.  The man working was chatting it up with the 3 other women who turned out to be together, and once they left he had a seat and didn't say a word to me as I browsed.  I walked out after several minutes of silence.",0
"Once again, THE TROUGH SLURPERS offer far too many stars to this mundane eatery, proving again that they are truly CANAILLE of the first order.:
Slow indifferent service
Mediocre food
The kind of wine that patrons of kokopelli swill with delight, calling it ambrosia when it's actually dishwater.
But..as with Kokopelli, it keeps the shit eaters out of the better restaurants! So, I say to you canaille..flock, flock there with your disruptive screaming children and your leathery palates.",2
"I don't think I have ever been to a restaurant where I have treated so poorly by the wait staff. I'm actually rethinking my Green rating because I sincerely think this is my worst restaurant experience.

The one good thing I can write is that this place is really cute and it has an inviting patio. Lots of string lights and cute bistro tables. I really thought I was in for a great evening. Oh how wrong I was.

My friend and I walked in and the hostess immediately sat us at a four top right in front of the door. Unless the restaurant is packed and the drafty table in front of the door is the last spot available, I do not want to sit in a place where incoming guests will constantly bump into my chair. I pointed to a seat in the back and after trying to convince me I didn't want *that* table, the hostess led us to the back. It's not the worst thing that could ever happen and that instance did not ruin my evening, it was just weird.

We sat and were greeted by our waitress, who initially seemed very nice. We both ordered water to start and I asked her for a drink menu. Apparently the drink menu is on the back of the regular menu. It's just so small that I missed it the first time. She told me that Friday night is the $4 frozen house margarita night, so I went with her suggestion. By the time I finish pulling out my ID, my dining partner was ready to order. We got a queso appetizer, the vegetarian tacos with a side salad, and the machaca plate.

While we waited, a few more groups came in, were greeted, and received their adult beverages. It had been ten minutes since I ordered my drink, so I tried to look for our waitress. 

She finally popped up five minutes later, but avoided all eye contact with our table. When she did see me, she quickly ran outside. I understand she might have had a few tables outside, but why have an inside section to wait as well? The table right next to us had an amazing server who brought them two orders of drinks in the time it took to get my water glass refilled. (Margarita was still MIA at this point.)

Then, the queso came out, brought by two hipsters. It looked like an over-microwaved styrofoam plate in a skillet and tasted just as bad. My friend tried to make the best out of the situation, but I was ready to call the manager. I really, really regret that I did not. 

Nasty queso juice dripped all over the table and there was no silverware or napkins to be found. AND no wait persons or a hostess to ask for said items. (Twenty minutes after I ordered my margarita, it was still MIA.)

Our waitress finally popped up and asked how the appetizer was. My friend cut me off and said it was different, but okay. He took rare this opportunity to ask for silverware. The waitress made an excuse that it should have been on the table already and went to grab some.  When she came back, I asked about my drink.

With another lame excuse that could have been avoided if she ever check on us in the then-thirty minute absence, she finally brought me my drink. It was OKAY, not worth $4... more like $2-3. 

Two seconds later, the food came out. At least we had silverware?

1) My veggie tacos and side salad were okay. Is it bad that the BEST part of meal was the white, iceberg lettuce salad?
2) My friend's machaca was bone dry. Isn't machaca supposed to be tender, rehydrated, and edible? 

All in all, the salsa was the best part of the meal. Yet, one cannot enjoy a dining experience on salsa alone. This was sincerely my worst experience at a restaurant and I will not go back to Mucho Gusto.",2
"Dropping down to three stars ... On a recent visit, I saw TWO roaches on the main floor of the restaurant. No one seemed to care, so I got up and stepped on one.  I pointed out the other, and one of the staff killed it, but they didn't seem surprised.  I know that roaches are hard to control, but having two of them wandering about in a busy restaurant just isn't a good thing. 

Also, our waiter was an overly chatty guy who seems to think we are interested in his voice.  They had some good staff in the past, but I suspect the owner, who likes to get drunk and hang out on the patio, gives me the impression of a guy who would be difficult to work for! 

The food is still decent and better than anything else I've found, but I'm looking for alternatives ...",0
Love love love this place!,1
"Pure Bliss - I haven't had a quality meal experience like this in a very very long time.  

The full 4 course dinner was stupendous and well worth every cent. 

You MUST try the Yin & Yang Martini!  It was  a very creative and well presented drink  that had me all smiles.  


I had the Smores & Chocolate desert and it was hands down my favorite (I've tried at least 5 others).",1
"I went to the one in Mesa on Baseline. I loved the vibe, service, and decor. They have witty jokes on the walls and the whole place makes you feel like you are at a party on the beach. We ordered the carne asada burrito and the mushroom burger and the sweet potato fries. We got the dessert pear and blackberry lemonades. You get 1 free refill so we tried the blood orange and the guava flavors after. Everything tasted great. I would def go back and get the mushroom burger. The prices are super cheap and the portions are huge.",1
Enjoyed date night here with the hubby. Try the gluten free pizza. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Mmmmmmm,1
"As far as Subway's go, this one is better than most than I have been to. I frequent this Subway quite often as it is the closest Subway to my office. The candor from the ""sandwich artists"" is always refreshing. You can tell most of them actually enjoy their jobs. Once I found a piece of plastic in my sandwich. You know when you open a bag of turkey and the edges of the bag are all tough to break open? A sliver of that ended up in my sandwich. The manager was quick to act and ended up making it a non-issue for me. I appreciated how he took charge and took care of it. Just another reason why I go back.",1
"Take your money elsewhere, unless you've got kids.  I really try to like this place.  A family member signed me up for the discount card, so I've been going more often, but I just don't love it.  It's simply ok, but the prices are outrageous.  And the sounds and animatronics are a huge distraction from the so-so food.  The cocktails are alright, but, again, the price is not right.  The ony thing fun about the place for an adult is the gift shop and the light-up cocktail glasses (which cost extra.)  I've seen a lot of happy families in here though, so I bet it's better if you have little ones to bring along.",2
"This place was never attractive to me, until it was the only place showing a good documentary I wanted to watch. Nice surprise! I only expect to see other good alternative movies here more often.",1
"Great service by Angela and their Doc
First time I don't have to wear reading glasses as they switched me to a mono contact
Very enjoyable experience and very quick
Had a issue with a contact and they track a replacement done right away
Definitely recommend",1
"Went here before the Jason Mraz concert and the Rock Shrimp appetizer, beers and cocktails were very good, however the service was a little slow. I ordered the angus cheeseburger and it came with a 1000 island dressing and pickles, a glorified Bigmac, what a disappointment.",0
"This restaurant is close to my office, so we go for lunch at least once a month.  I love that it's bright, with great modern decor, and the seating is comfortable.  Service is always very good.  The prices and portions are a average for the area.  The cuisine is a twist on Sonoron, but nothing extraordinary.",1
"To say this place is super rad would be an understatement!!  We for las noches de las luminarias.  And I wish we could've stayed longer, also seeing the gardens during the daylight is added to the 'to do' list!  

Having never been there the staff was super helpful in guiding us, not to mention really friendly!  The music was entertaining and a good variety.  They also have a synthetic ice rink and you're allowed up to 15 minutes of skating, if you're not shy!  The buffet they offered was a joke and I don't recommend doing it.  For 16.50, you're only allowed one trip through and other such silly stipulations... no thanks.   

Other than that, what a great place to go!",1
"Breakfast. The best crispy chicken fried steak and eggs this side of Texas. Served with country gravy, hash browns and garnished with a slice of cantaloupe and honey dew melon for under $7. The green chili cheese burger is also one of my favorites, served any time of day or night. Only down side is getting past all the unwashed morons gambling and chain smoking cigarettes.",1
"Not bad.  Very large story that has about everything you'd want, and open 24 hours.",1
"I have been here a few times but have to remember to come here more often. 

I LOVE it! 

I've never made it past the refrigerated and prepared foods section, but who needs to! You can find everything you need right there. 

The meat section is beautiful to look at, they have a whole section of prepared heat and eat dinners, side, soups, sauces etc. grab a premade one or grab a few ingredients and make your own! 

My favorite so far would be the Tub of Alfredo sauce, package of fresh pasta, and package of chicken breast strips ..YUM! 
Dinner in 20 anyone? ;-)

Their Tomato basil soup is Amazing too!! 

I scored dinner for 3 last night for ......$7!!!! 
2 packages of their heat and eat mac and cheese and 2 packages of Tilapia, all ready and in about 10 minutes! 

Seriously if you are trying to save money and still want to eat good, fresh and easy food then this your place!",1
Love Bakers. I live in Glendale an it is worth the drive to go see them. They know their stuff and am always pleased with my purchases.,1
"I went thier on a new wave night. I dont drink so its hard to find somewhere gay that I can enjoy sober. They had bitchin 80's music and had a good guy/girl ratio. Some were straight but I like that, its nice when breeders what to hang out just for the fact that they wnat to hang out and dont care if your gay/straight.

They also have a pool table wich is a rare find in gay clubs in az.

I liked it :)",1
"My mom and I stopped by for a late lunch yesterday. The menu and the food were the same as other Paradise locations. This location wasn't nearly as busy as the others which provided a nice and quiet meal for my mom and I. The onlt downfall was that I have experienced friendlier staff at the other locations. But overall, it was a decent dining experience. 

The thing I love about Paradise is their consistency. The food always tastes the same each and every time. And I have yet to find anything I don't like.",1
"I don't usually shop at AJ's unless I am looking for something very specific that I cannot find anywhere else. The item in the past has been canoli shells. I like to make home made canolis occassionally but I am never daring enough to make the shells. I can never find them anywhere other than AJ's. I would say that if you are looking for something special that the average grocery store doesnt have, try AJ's. They are a bit expensive though so I would go here as a last resort. Now normally, I would give this place only 3 stars, however, yesterday, I discovered their dessert counter. OMG, I was in heaven! I knew they had cakes and fruit tarts (which btw are outstanding although 30.00 apiece), however, they also have a vast array of mini gourmet desserts for when you have a major sweet craving and want something special to satisfy it. Im talking mini carrot cakes, mini fruit tarts (yes!!! I dont have to pay 30.00 whenever I want a tart from them), mini tiramisu's rounds, brownies, canoli's (WTF?) and even mini creme brulees! Additionally, they have home made chocolates which looked equally delicious. I opted for the tiramisu which was not only tantalizing but light, creamy, and honestly, one of the best Tiramisu's Ive had in awhile probably since the wine train in Napa. My best friend said that her praline chocolates were very good as well. I got a brownie for the hubby which is enormous and I will post an update once he tries it. What's even better is that the mini desserts are really reasonably priced so if you are looking for a dessert for someone to celebrate a birthday, anniversary, whatever, this is a great place to go.",1
"Best place around for sweet and sour chicken! The kids meals rock as they come with fried rice, a choice of meat and beef skewers. Did I mention their only 5-6 bucks? Little outdoor seating patio. The only thing we've found on the menu none of my family likes it the egg rolls.  Good prices and food.",1
"I was excited to check out Sleepy Dog after seeing all of it's 4 and 5-star reviews, and finally made it in. I must say...both beers I enjoyed were delicious. Establishment itself is small but unique and modern, and their whole theme around dogs rocks. The only drawback, is they do not serve food....well, the whole reason I went here was to meet up with a friend for dinner and a beer or two. I was shocked at this. We ended up having a pizza delivered from a pizza place down the street, which went well with our beers. One great thing, was they have a ton of flat screens all around. One had a corny late 80's action movie playing which was very entertaining, and something you don't experience everyday. All in all, I did like Sleeping Dog, and would like to go back. I saw the popcorn maker as we left! Beer was just as good/better than the other breweries in the area.",1
"Pretty cool place that appeals to 2 very different crowds. 

My friends and I stayed downstairs for the majority of the night. The hip hop music was pretty good and the DJ had a excellent music selection. The bartenders were very friendly, except for one of the blonde girls. When I put my empty beer bottle on the bar, she took it and I raised my hand to say ""thank you"" for taking it. Then she came back with another beer that I didn't order, and I think she got a little pissed because she misunderstood me. At the end of the night, I asked for some water and she only gave me a bottle instead of just a cup of tap water and charged me $2. Don't be a hater lady!!

GET A SHOT OF CAFE PATRON!!! If you like coffee and patron, it's literally the best of both worlds. And, to top it all off, they are only $3 A SHOT!! Very reasonably priced. I had 3 within a span of an hour (I'm a heavyweight so I wouldn't recommend that for everyone!)

Upstairs, they have techno/house music and it's packed like no other. The people are really cool though. They have friendly battles and it's pretty cool to just watch them for about 10 minutes. Depending on your scene, you can pick either floor.",1
"I have had chicken. I have had waffles. And now, I've had chicken AND waffles. 

Prior to today, I didn't realize the distinction. Prior to today, I never had cause to consider the combination. Prior to today, I didn't realize what I was missing.

Now let's be clear: this isn't the place for dieters. It's not a place for any pretentious behavior. The place has ""Chicken & Waffles"" in the name, OK? And that's what you're going to get. In abundance.

Cheap as hell. I had the #1, also known as KK's. Three huge-ass pieces of chicken -- breas, thigh and mutant leg. All battered and fried to perfection. Two waffles the size of Vermont. A bucket of grits with some egg/cheese/onion concoction on the side. OK, I could have done without the last part. But hey, when in a chicken & waffle place...

I'm still full. I won't eat dinner tonight. I crashed out for an hour in post-prandial bliss. And I'd have typed this review faster if I could have stopped sucking my fingers like a four-year-old.

Damn.",1
"Great cleaners, open weird hours, always polite to me, anyhoo.",1
"It was consistently the best carne adobada, now consistency is the one thing they don't have. Beer selection, menu, wait staff and most importantly quality seem to change every time I'm in. Please figure it out soon...",0
"Good rates
Great location- near food, shopping
Quiet area
Rooms have kitchens
Free Wifi and Breakfast

For a business traveler these are the big selling points- it's kinda basic but loads of features.",1
"I came to Timo for my birthday last week after hearing rave reviews about it from a few friends of mine. I met up with the fabulous Jennifer T. and I was so happy to check this place out!

I like any place that I get to walk in through a back door. I passed through the very chill looking patio area first, another plus in my book. Plenty of outdoor seating that looked dangerously inviting once this hot hot heat cools off. Inside was intimate, but with the large windows, it wasn't dark and depressing. Like your own little happy wine bar world.

They have an amazing wood burning oven. Normally, that itself is plenty good enough, but then there's the food that comes out of that wonderful oven. I only tried the spinach and artichoke dip, which was the best I have ever had! It didn't have a pool of oil (first time for everything!), it was so fresh, and I really appreciated seeing the bread sliced fresh right in front of us, since we were sitting at the bar. I saw several other things (flatbread)  come out of that oven, and I will have to go back to try them! Everything smelled delicious and was presented with a touch of class without being pretentious. I was also very intrigued by the eggplant dip which is apparently ""better than baba!"" 

Now for the drinks. Holy cow. I've been drinking a few years now, so safe to say, I've tried many, many drinks. Or so I thought. Coconut mojito anyone!? Made with Ciroc Coconut vodka!  As tasty as mojitos are, I don't get a long well with rum, so vodka was a pleasant surprise, and the coconut just brought the mmmmmazing factor to a whole new level. I also tried the white sangria, another 5 stars. Great wine list too- Apothic Red is one of a few reds I like, and they have it!  

The staff was top notch as well. I arrived shortly before a shift change, and both bartenders were personable and hard working, and truly seemed to enjoy what they were doing. I'm pretty bad with names unfortunately, or I would love to mention them.

I can't wait to go back! For drinks and food! I think I'd even go alone for lunch if I didn't have any company!",1
"There is nothing quite like Persian food;  it is complex, delicious and sometimes like nothing you've ever tasted.   Apart from dad's kitchen and sit-down places in Tempe and Scottsdale, there are limited places to find it in the Valley.  Do yourself a favor and don't order a gyro;  you can find one anywhere.  Order one of the daily specials at their crazy cheap prices for Persian food and enjoy!  I've had nearly all of them and they rock!  These dishes take all day to make; believe me I know and you can taste why.  And do not miss the saffron ice cream with rose water and pistachios.",1
"So, I avoided this place like the plague for the longest time.  No reason really, it just never caught my attention.  It always seemed to be empty, which led me to believe it must not be that great.  Well, don't judge a book until you walk in and try the spaghetti! 

The Bollo Neapolitan has been my favorite pasta so far and the steak sandwich is to die for.  I'm telling you- I never order steak sandwiches and I fell in love!   I've tried a few of the other pastas and they were ok, but the Bollo Neapolitan was my fav with the runner up being the Garlic Shrimp Pasta.

Now for the Negatives.  The chicken on the pasta just never really tastes right to me.  I don't know what it is, but it has a very gamey taste.  The dishes I've tried without chicken have been far superior in my view.  

Finally, I've never seen this place packed.  That can be a negative or a positive depending on my mood, but I would like to see a few more patrons.  So, if you don't want to wait in line at the other Italian joint in the AMC 30 complex (Macaroni Grill) or are looking for a non chain option, check out Neapolitan! The service has always been great too.

Bottom Line: I'm glad to finally have a decent Italian choice when going to the movies at AMC 30.",1
"Not that you can compare Firebird to anywhere else in Az but I have been to Joliet Raceway in Chicago (and even though that's newer) I like the arrangement of Firebird and the availability of the different tracks available to race on.

First off...  NHRA... come on... hands down one of THE coolest events in Az ever, next to NASCAR and well pro any sports but the 8000hp cars come only once a year.  The pits are setup nice so every ticket gets into the pits to check out the teams and cars, beer and food are expensive but what else is new.

They also have drag racing events, any type of racing event, drift, road, moto races, dirt bikes, monster trucks, top fuel drag boats on the lake... I'm sure I'm missing a lot but nowhere else has this in Az.

Parking is always good to go... driving out of there just takes a while as you've got one main road that you get on to funnel onto the I-10 but not much they can do about that.

Great place... keep bringing in the NHRA and letting us use the road tracks for our motorcycles and I'll be happy.",1
"Great quality. Their Pad Thai with chicken is the best I've ever had. Fresh, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. Their Yupha's Fried Rice is delicious with the pineapple compliments. Their Red Curry gets a 2 star rating for just being Red Curry (it's not as creamy, fresh, or flavorful as Thai Basil on University). It's a neighborhood gem and I'm lucky enough to live right around the corner from Yupha's Thai Kitchen!

Also, it's clean, bright, and has an inviting ambiance. It's perfect for a sit in casual dining experience, and even nice for takeout. 

Staff is friendly and attentive. 

Come here. Seriously.",1
"Yum! I was a fan of Grimaldi's...but this place surpasses them! We had half chicken tuscana (garlic cream sauce) and half chicken artichoke (pesto sauce). Amazing! Great flavors! Usually, I'm a fan of ranch on pizza fan (don't hate)--not needed here!
Comes with the traditional crust, which was really enjoyable, but also available w/thin crust or wheat crust ($2 extra for wheat).
Server (Zach) was nice, offered suggestions, and was on top of things. Kind of soft spoken, given the tv's and other restaurant noise. Hostess seemed like she was pretty excited to be there and everyone was polite.
Prices weren't too bad--$18 for a large pizza, $8 for an individual. Variety of toppings, salads, appetizers, calzones, and drinks. Beers ranged from $3.75-$5 for the 16 oz. 
Excited to go back and try some more pizza!",1
"I went for family birthday on a Friday night. Only a few people in dining room eating. (1st clue to leave.) Ordered a margarita. It's extra to have it shaken... But I ordered that way. It was mostly sour mix. An it was awful (How do you mess up a margarita?(2nd clue to leave) Server is surprised we wanted to order dinner! (3rd clue to run!) Very disappointing. I got the chicken fajitas, they had sauce all over them. Shrimp appetizer consists of 3 shrimp $8. Salsa was good.  I will never go back. Good luck Salty. I love your decor. Why don't you care you could be so cool!",2
"Let me start by saying the crawfish ettouffee was the best I've had in a long time! The food itself should probably get 4 stars, however, our service was just plain bad, so I'm just going with 3 stars.

The outside patio area was really nice and they had live music and a bar outside.",0
"Best Thai food for your dollar in the entire valley. I'm no Thai expert, but I have been to at least a dozen here in the valley. Keep in mind - this is NOT a fancy place - just a simple, inexpensive, casual dining experience. WOW!",1
"If you've read some of my other reviews you'll see a trend. 

Kohl's Department Stores.....Brewers spring training...... 

Yep, I'm a cheesehead. (But if you EVER actually catch me wearing a hunk of fake foam cheese on my head, shoot me. Really.) 

What can I say? I like Culver's. It reminds me of home. It's total comfort food. 

Got one of their Wisconsin Swiss melts. What other fast food joints offer burgers with Swiss on rye? The crinkle cut fries are always hot and fresh. And tasty. 

Culver's is known for their frozen custard. What Wisconsinite has not driven past a Culver's, looked at their sign, checked out the 'flavor of the day', and gone, ""Hey, that sounds good!!"", and quickly pulled into the parking lot? 

If you're from Wisconsin or the Midwest stop in for a Butterburger and some custard....it will bring back lots of good memories. 

Like another reviewer noted when he said he felt like he was in Iowa or something.....well.....that's the whole charm behind Culver's. You DO feel like you're in Wisconsin or one of the upper Midwest states. 

Granted I'm not the best person to review Culver's....I'm a little biased towards it. But if you want a 'different' kind of fast food experience and you've never been to the upper Midwest, it's a heck of a whole lot cheaper than flying there. 

Give it a chance....see if you like it.",1
"Back again.  Still thinking about the flatbread pizza w/ tandoori chicken. I told my friend not to order it as an appetizer b/c I felt it would be too much food intake.  One of the best things I've eaten in a while.  I can't wait to order that as my MAIN dish next time. Soooooo good. You gotta try it!
The chutney and all the flavor combinations were perfect.  It didn't sound so special on the menu, but it is!",1
"I'm pretty sure that Palee's Crown is the best Thai place I have ever been to. The service is always great, and the Owner comes out to talk to us whenever we are there.
The food is so amazing, I have never tried something that I disliked at all. I especially love the Pad Thai and the Currys. I am always full and completely satisfied by the time I leave. I also recommend trying the Thai Iced Tea to drink if you are like me and enjoy weird authentic drinks, and for dessert be sure to get the coconut ice cream. Don't make excuses about trying to spend less money or that you are being careful about what you're eating, just try it.
The prices are good and if you're not sure what to try, stick with a curry but remember that Asian spices are very distinct, and very spicy.",1
"I have no idea why I haven't dined or noshed during happy hour at this place more often, I've always had great service, great wine, and great food. There is no adequate excuse , but anyway, my third adventure here made me update my review to 5 stars because 5th and Wine has earned it.

The wines by the glass range from $8 - $11 unless you come in before 6pm then they are only $5! Those prices alone should make you want to come here for drinks with friends. The servers have always been cool with offering samples if you can't make up your own mind between two wines despite the recommendation from the server and your friend saying ""just pick one!"". Due to this fact, I've always had a glass that I have enjoyed, which is usually a Zinfandel. 

I have now had the pleasure of experiencing all of their different types of bruschetta. My top two favorites are the Prosciutto, Mascarpone, Figs, and Tomato Jam which has a great combination of salty and sweet, and the Apples, Brie, and Fig Jam one which is on the sweeter side, but not overwhelming because the bread and the tart granny smith apple slices help balance out the flavor. The Chopped Salad is very light and refreshing option to accompany the brushcetta appetizer. 5th and Wine is also a restaurant so other food options are available, I have sampled the Chicken and Pesto Pasta which has a delicious cream sauce and their Mac & Cheese which is super rich with the two types of melted cheese, but both items are delicious.

The atmosphere is great whether you are sitting inside or outside. The lighting is soft, giving more of an intimate feel, yet this place still remains simple and casual, which I love. The outside patio is great, it is a courtyard that offers peeks into store windows while remaining private from the traffic of Old Town. The times I have been here it has never been super crowded and I am able to just walk in and be seated right away. 5th and Wine still feels like a hidden gem and you must try it out!",1
Nothing special about this place.  Clean and the food is okay. I go because my one son loves it.  Have to keep the kids happy.  Never had a bad experience but never had anything stand out either.  My fav dish is the Spinach artichoke dip.,0
"Please know that this place is WORTH the long wait.  I come to Phoenix once a month for work and I make sure I have dinner here.  There is NOT one thing I can complain about.  Remember, good things come to those who wait.  I HIGHLY recommend waiting in the house next door and having some wine.  The bartenders are very friendly.  The main restaurant will call the house when your table/bar seat is ready.  The pizza is baked in a stone brick oven.  Real firewood is used, not like California Pizza Kitchen's gas oven.  The owner himself makes the pizza.  Every employee is genuinely nice.  With each bite, you have a subtle taste of smoke (not overwhelming).  The crust is thin and crispy...AND MOST IMPORTANTLY...you can fold the slice - for all you NJ/NY natives!  My stomach is churning and mouth salivating as I write more.  I am going to Phoenix this Thursday...guess where I'll be?  PS-Guys, phenomenal eye candy.",1
"This review is based on an event I attended here. I did not stay at the hotel as a guest or experience the bar. I was a guest at the Etiquette Dinner put on by ASU and affiliates. From the moment I entered the hotel, I felt welcomed. Each employee I passed greeted me with a smile and professionality. I thought the hotel interior was really cool also. When I was leaving the event, I thought how strange that locals never frequent hotels in their cities. I should try it!",1
"This is one of my favorite little gems in Phoenix. I've never had better pho than here. I usually order the ""spicy beef sate"" pho, which is miles above the rare beef pho. My family and I also order the pork ""spicy treats"" which is a roll-your-own spring roll. It's delicious and fun! One order feeds all five of us. 

The owner is also extremely nice. They also offer discounts to ASU students! Have to love that.",1
"I really enjoy writing reviews praising a place for great food, service, ambiance, and value, or any combination of these. Unfortunately, this isn't one of those reviews. 

This is a fish story... No, not about the big one that got away. Nor is it about the time I was fly fishing with my dad and had to rescue him because he stepped in a deep hole and sank when his waders filled with water.... this is about the trout that saved the day.

When my wife and I arrived at the Greene House, it was earlier in the evening, still happy hour, though we were there for dinner not appetizers. Checked-in with the hostess and were quoted a  quoted 30-45 minute wait for a table. We knew the place was popular so weren't upset with the wait as we were looking forward to a wonderful dinner.

Went to the bar to order wine and that's when our disappointment started. We were sitting in plain view at the edge of the bar facing the entry and there were TWO bartenders,  In spite of this, in the 15 minutes we waited, occasionally waving and saying ""excuse me"" to get the bartenders' attention, we never even got so much as a Hi, and certainly not an opportunity to order a drink.

I had only just told my wife I wasn't willing to wait another 15-30 minutes wine free when the hostess pleasantly surprised us by saying a table was ready. Our relief was short lived however.

After being seated, it was approximately 5 minutes before our server came to the table. We ordered wine and water.

Our wine and water came NINE minutes later... a total of over 30 minutes since we entered the restaurant before we received our first beverage.

We skipped an appetizer, planning ahead for dessert, and for our entree ordered Rainbow Trout with a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries.

Approximately 15 minutes later, our SIDE of Truffle Parmesan Fries showed up... sans trout. 

When asked about the missing trout, she said it'd be a few more minutes because the kitchen was backed up. When asked why she brought the side of fries, she said she thought we wanted them first, a leap of logic that totally escaped us. 

When our server said she could take the fries back ""to keep them warm until our trout was ready"", my wife and I looked at each other in amazement and made a spontaneous decision that given we were now STARVING, our original side of fries would serve us better as a hot appetizer than as a reheated side with dinner.

Finally, a few minutes after our Truffle Parmesan Fries were gone, our trout arrived. As I indicated in the begining, it saved the day. The fish was fresh, perfectly prepared and exceptional.

As good as the trout was however, is wasn't good enough to make us ever return to the Greene House. There is no reason any customer should suffer through such slow and uninspired service when there are at least a dozen restaurants within a 2 mile radius of this one (much less dozens more throughout the Phoeniz metro area), that are SIGNIFICANTLY more enjoyable. 

Spend your hard earned money somewhere else",2
"Writing my 7/29/11 review prompted me to return to this establishment for a manicure. I got there at 9am, but unfortunately the sign on the door states they don't open until 10am. So I ran a few errands and returned at 10am. There was no one in the store and all the lights were out. Again, it is already over 100 degrees outside by 10am. I decided I didn't need a manicure that bad and left.",2
"Things I loved: 
The Thom Kha Ta-lay (med) was creamy, spicy, and FULL of seafood and fresh kaffir leaves. The chicken satay had a nice char but was still juicy (so rare!). The cucumber and onion relish was surprisingly sweet and a great counter to the heat. 

Things I only liked:
The Pork Kwediaw Kraphrao (mint and pepper stir fry with egg noodles) was not as mediumly spiced and could have used a touch more mintyness. They were out of Pumpkin Custard, which made me very sad as it sounded awesome.

Verdict: 
I would go back to try a curry or rice dish, for sure!",1
"How much is good pizza worth? Is it worth being subjugated by a tyrranical owner slinging expensive pizza? 

Maybe, but only if it's really good, which the pizza at Joe's happens to be. Decisions, decisions. 

It smacks of the soup nazi in its unfortunate contradiction. If the pizza weren't so delicious, this would be a quick and decisively negative review. Sadly, for me the reviewer, for me the consumer, it isn't that easy.

My suggestion is to go during the day, before Joe is embittered by partiers and the lunch special is readily available.",1
"I didn't pay much attention to this place for several years.  Passed it many times, just didn't catch my eye enough for me to remember it on those nights when I desperately try to think of some new place to try.

I've since been here twice (over about a 3 month time span), and I really love it.  First time, had great food (all server recommendations - although he disappeared prior to arrival of meal, seemed to be doing side work so he could bolt out).  Great although somewhat minimal service for the second half of our dinner, former waiter did not say he was leaving, we sat for a little while before someone new arrived.  Ambiance and company made it barely noticeable.   Personally, I don't care as long as I get good service.  We're not family, I don't need an apology or heartfelt goodbye.  The garlic app - what it is called? - your server will know, it's probably their most popular dish, it is AMAZING.  Order this unless you hate garlic or are on a diet.  I consider myself a good cook, but I would leave this up to Richardsons.  As I write this I realize the whole reason for my review is that dish, because I don't remember anything else I had.  Stopped by for drinks the second time, ended up ordering a pizza, expected little since it didn't mesh with the menu, it was really quite good.  Bartender was great (I think he was actually the take-over waiter from my previous visit).  Very cozy place, if you come later or are are willing to wait, you can get a private table in a cave like nook.  The place is not cheap, comparative to other finer dining establishments.  Overall, a lively but romantic place with character, good food, and decent service.",1
"I will start with our experience from the time we walked in. The customers sitting in the restaurant stared and some laughed. I guess we missed the whites only sign on the front door. However my husband and I love to try new things and don't care what people think. The hostess however was nice and pleasant. Our waiter was also great.  The food here was delicious for an appetizer we had the stuffed mushrooms which were to die for. Our main entrees were the German meatloaf and my husband ordered the tenderloin. My whipped potatoes were so delicious. The cabbage was awesome not to sweet not to salty and the meatloaf was refreshing. My husband enjoyed his tenderloin and fries as well. It was seasoned perfectly.

The skinny is if you don't mind being treated like the 13th amendment was never signed by the patrons of Haus Murphy's and want some Excellent German food this is the place to go. The staff here were great though.",0
"Margaritas were good, tacos were fair (small), guacamole was wonderful. after ten it gets really loud here. They need to have tequila flights.",2
"I have to admit, I normally don't like Chinese food. In fact, it's just about the only style of food I haven't fallen in love with at some point in my life. This is a real problem when you live with someone that would die for Chinese food at all hours of the day/night. 

I figured out why I never liked Chinese food when I first ate at Asian Cafe Express. It's because everything I've had has been Americanized Chinese Food!!!  It was like an epiphany and seriously music to my tastebuds when I actually found Chinese food I not only liked, I LOVED! Having authentic Chinese food changed my opinion completely about this cuisine.

I have to agree with the others... save yourself the time and skip the first few pages. Go straight to the back of the menu to find authentic Hong Kong Style fare. Holy mother of god, everything I've tried has been outstanding and each time I leave saying it was the best meal I've tried thus far. 

Everything is extremely cheap and the service is superb. The wait staff are always very helpful and knowledgeable about their food. They'll be quick to recommend something if you're having a hard time deciding. Just ask!",1
Been a loyal customer since they opened ten years ago.  Quality cut and great people. These are professional barbers who have been doing this for years.  No froo froo!  Russian not spoken there!,1
"i've been a mojo fan since... well, since mojo first became mojo. when yogurtology opened right up the street from my house, i arched a skeptical brow and decided to give the mojo-wannabe a try. 

*long sigh*

my newfound love of yogurtology has me feeling a little guilty, as if i've replaced an old love with a new one. such is life, i suppose.

the facts:

yogurtology has a wide range of excellent flavors of frozen yogurt that seem to rotate daily. i've seen chocolate mint, oreo, cupcake batter, red velvet, chocolate peanut butter, mango, blackberry, oatmeal cookie and vanilla bean, to name a few. each and every one delish. they also seem to always have at least one non-dairy option available...

the toppings are plentiful and varied. choose from fresh fruit, chopped candy bars, m&ms, nuts, baklava, brownies, truffles, cheesecake, sprinkles galore, ginormous marshmallows and gummy candy... i've never seen so many topping options in one place.

staff are very friendly and attentive. a little TOO attentive for my taste, but hey, i'm the kind of person who likes to be left alone unless i ask for help...overall, they rock!

loyalty punch-card? you betcha. so eat and eat and eat and score yourself some free yogurtology before starting the tasty process all over again.

lick a spoon and feed your grin.

"This is one of the franchise store of Ritz Camera in Chandler. The store's staffs are nice, however, their photo lab is miss leading. They make the price in very small fonts and hanging on the ceiling. 

For the first time user to print photos in the lab, I was charged for $45 for just few 4x6 and 8x10 print without sign-in as member. I asked for canceling order prior they print the photos. I was told ""Too late"" even it's still in one of their store pc for ordering prints. 

Since they are franchise, I should be able to return or exchange the accessories I bought for my Nikon D70S camera in different store. I was told ""No"". I can only exchange or return to the stores I purchase them. 

I will not buy anything from them again.",2
"This is a great family resort if you need a villa with a kitchen, washer/dryer and space. We have stayed at Marriott Vacation Clubs all over the U.S. and we really love it here. It's not too big but is in a perfect location for us. You can use the pool at the JW Marriott across the way, but my kids loved the pool here and it's easier to use. The pool was heated to a perfect temperature!  Across the way is the Desert Ridge Marketplace with an Albertson's, 24 hour CVS, Einstein bagels, many other fun restaurants, AMC movies, big box shopping like Marshall's, Ross, etc. It's very convenient for shopping and dining as well as getting to the 101 highway for all of the fun places to go nearby. 

I also found a great nail place across from Desert Ridge called ""All About Nails"". Very nice and very clean - plus reasonably priced.

We will return when we need a Scottsdale base for vacation. Our only complaint was check in was 2.5 hours late (6:30 PM instead of 4:00 PM), and the lack of pool towels on 2 days. Otherwise a well-run vacation club.",1
"My first ever trip to Bass was overwhelming. Like walking into a Sportsman's Warehouse that had mated with Dick's Sporting Goods, and then gone on steroids. Bass Pro Shops is an outdoor person's dream. 

And it's good for the whole family, oddly enough!

Once you get inside this massive place, you have an upstairs and downstairs. There is a kid's area, a restaurant with fresh fish, a huge women's section and mens, and areas for fishing and boats and hunting and camping and survival and gear for any occasion. You can look at the giant fish tank, climb up a faux rock side for $3, and just be purely entertained for ages. They have snack foods and jerky and sweets. BBQ grills. Do they have guns? I don't know, probably! They have GPS equipment and water bottles and on and on and on. 

It was exhausting in a great way. My camping/outdoors needs tend to be more mimimalist oriented so I prefer an REI. But I like it here a lot. I picked up some socks that have a lifetime guarantee, and a nice woolen shirt for almost nothing, and a couple of gifts for the hunter/outdoors people in my life back in Tucson.

Bass: it is an experience.",1
"The salmon was great. They overcooked my husbands steak, which was just a so-so steak. City hall is much preferred!",2
"You speak Italian to me and provide mouth watering, soul lifting coconut gelato with micro-chips of chocolate in them?!  I only wish you weren't 30 miles away...but I would walk in 116 degree heat to get there - for real!",1
"It does not get much better than this, fellas.

BS West is hands down the best gay bar in Phoenix.

Friendly bartenders, cheap drinks, good-looking crowd, great music..it's definitely got it all.

Best night to check out is the obvious 2-4-1 Wednesday. 

Thursdays and Sundays can also be fun if you're into karaoke. Saturdays are a nice alternative if you don't really dig Forbidden or Amsterdam, it's a different crowd.

It definitely has a ""Cheers"" feeling to it... not pretentious whatsoever. Great patios too, especially the back one with the new video screen they installed.

Oh, and their Halloween bash is THE party to be at. 3,000 people attended in 2007.",1
"I grew up on Empanadas in Panama and I have been hard pressed to find anything close to them in the U.S.. today I found them! 

A perfectly crunchy crust and the beef was beautifully spiced. Usually Empanadas are bland and soggy. They did a great job on these.

I usually don't like rice, but the rice and black beans were wonderful. 

Service was great! I'll be back!",1
"Thank goodness someone took over what once was pink taco, aka yuck city, and turned it into something worth stopping in when in Scottsdale. Fox Concepts yet again has made a success and a place I think I will actually return to. 

To start with we had a delicious plate of cheese and meats from the anti pasta menu, along side with some marinated olives and bread w/ olive oil. Just enough to get our taste buds excited and just enough to have my boyfriend (who is not into fancy smancy stuff) say ""give me some more"".  These went nicely with our beers (they've got a great list), my mother's martini (which she seemed to enjoy), and my brother's gin on the rocks (he says they carry a gin that is very rare and delicious but the name didn't stick with me-sorry). 

All of our dinner plates were delicious; fried chicken w/ mashed tatters & biscuits (skin on chicken was a little on the salty side but very crunchy), salmon w/ apple and rice, grilled cheese sliders(who could mess those up?), chicken salad, prime rib dip (served with onion soup instead of au jus, yum yum), and the patato ghesicuto (pasta- I know I can't spell but it was yummy too). Around the table, everyone seemed pretty satisfied.

My only criticisms would be that we were seating just to the side of the kitchen, enough to be able to look inside. I dig places that leave it open so you can watch your foot and the chefs are aware that the client is aware of whats going on BUT I did watch one man on the end prepare countless dishes without gloves on. He went from cutting and laying out proscuitto onto creating their carmel kettle corn dessert (scooping with bare hands), to setting out what appeared to be the fondue app. Yes, there can be worse things that happen in a restaurant but as someone who has worked in food service, it made me squirm a bit. I suppose that's why it's called Culinary Dropout.

...oh, and the music was a bit too loud for me. Great joint for out with friends on the way to the bar or I would think for happy hour but not for a family dinner (my Grandma had to barrow a flashlight from the waitress it was so dark).",0
"Too bad about Mandalay Noodle World. Maybe if they had stressed better service and played up the Burmese aspect they would have had better luck. Who knows?

Betito's moved in, and they're okay. The wife and I stopped in yesterday. I had a carne asada torta and a taco and both were about average. Their hot salsa took it up a notch though. My wife had something with diablo in the name (sorry, I'll have to look at the menu when I get home) and loved it. They do the usual menudo on weekends and the whole place is more or less along the lines of a Filiberto's--not that there's anything wrong with that. The whole bill was less that $20, so prices are good. 

Clean enough place, cheap, food is okay, and service is adequate. I would not go out of my way to get there, but if it is in your neighborhood it is worth a try. I'll probably stop here from time to time.",0
Great martini's and they even have Absynthe if you're looking to get crazy. Great looking modern style bar and lounge.,1
"I hate for my first official review to be a one star review but Macayo's really disappointed me last night. When I first pulled into the parking lot last night I was surprised to see how many empty parking spaces there were. I immediately got excited because normally any restaurant on Bell road any night of the week has a wait. However, when I walked inside I saw a slew of people waiting to be seated. I walked up to the hostess stand and put my name on the list and the hostess did not give me a time quote and when I asked how long it would be she quoted me, ""not too long."" We waited about 15 minutes before being shown to our table which is where the trouble really began. 

Once we were at our table we were quickly greeted by our server (yay) however, she told us she had another table's drink order to get and then she would be back for ours (boo). So we waited for her to take the other two tables drink orders before coming back to take ours. 

After about 10 minutes we got our fountain drinks and then 5 minutes later she came back to take our food order. Then it took about 50 minutes for our food to come out. Seriously, 50 minutes.... that's about how long I planned to spend at Macayo's not how long I planned on waiting for my appetizer of taquitos to take to come out. And to top it off we were missing a side of rice and a side of baja sauce. We decided not to mention it as we did not want to wait another hour for the two items to come out. So, after eating and waiting for our drinks to be refilled 3 times we finally got the check to which the server apologized for our wait. Apparently, she couldn't have apologized at all during our 50 minute minute wait she needed to wait until tip time. 

I don't recommend going to Macayos. You might have better luck at any of the other 10 Mexican restaurants on Bell Road.",2
"Dined outside. It's a must do when the weather is right.
Fit's nicely into the 'Fashion Square' mentality an aura.
Great appetizers and they did a great job on the steak.
We'll go back again sometime.",1
I've always had a pleasant experience at Mojo in Tempe Marketplace. I have been to this location about 4 times and they always provide good quality and value. My favorite is the red velvet froyo.,1
"I like these sort of ""mom & pop"" spots, small and intimate setting.  Great pizza!  I always enjoy the veggie pizza with jalapenos, oh so good!  And mu hubby loves the suicide wings, but we've tried almost everything off of the menu and you CANNOT go wrong.  Prices rock too!",1
My wife turned me on to this gem. Her family has been eating here since the 70's it never disappoints. The machaca is moist not wet like many others. The Pepsi from the fountain is the best fountain soda anywhere.,1
"I will never go back to this establishment because all of the bouncers and wait staff are unfriendly, unprofessional and disrespectful.",2
"Prices are reasonable and the food is always good.  It may be a typical bar food type menu but the food itself is far superior to what you will find in most bar restaurants.  I even like the food here better than the stuff they serve at some of the competition (chain places like TGI Fridays or Applebees).  In addition to good food Four Peaks has great beer and drinks.  I can't recommend this place enough.

Don't worry about the line or the bouncer checking ID at the door.  The service is always fast and friendly even when the place is full to the brim.  There is always a big, big crowd.  If you worry about the noise just sit outside under the misters...",1
"Went to the Rooste for a Christmas Eve dinner among a small group (9) friends. I had never been. Had heard the name many times over the years when I had previously lived in Tempe. 

Been intimidated that by where it set that it was expensive and swanky. That's all a lie! It sets up high and has a wonderful view. It's not located where you are just strolling down the street and decided to pop in that is true. You wind through these grounds to the back of the property pass beautiful fountains and buildings until you come to the lite up restaurant. You can self park but why bother go for the valet. 

You pass a smelly ranch steer at the entry that is probably wondering why the hell its there as much as I was. Inside the door the smell escapes you immediately, thank goodness. You see some young sap making cotton candy and wonder what the heck have I arrived at. A few more steps and you see you are in a western theme establishment, by the overwhelming amount of raw wood beams and flooring. 
First stop the bar. It's a limited full bar and for this it losses a star. 
From the bar the view outside is great and you can look down and see the country music band playing (it was a band but I wouldn't book 'em) but hey they gave the place a little extra pulse. You see the staff in casual western gear also and you instantly know you're welcome in your jeans. 

Moments later our table was ready and half of us choose to take the slide down to the dining floor and the others took the steps. Hey I went for the slide! It was short and fast and another reason to come casually dressed. 

Our waitperson was a delightful and articulate young woman. We skipped the appetizers to leave room for dessert (next time I'll reverse that decision). The menu was very good. Several steak cuts, enchiladas, fried chicken, BBQ beef & pork ribs, Seafood, a burger, pork chops, most plates $15 - $20. 

While waiting for the salad course a magician name Flash comes up and asks if we'd like some magic that night (he works for tips). He went about his tricks and blew our minds! THIS GUY I WOULD HIGHER for an event. Never figured out how he did what he did but would love to see him doing it again and again. So if he comes by your table take him up on his offer of magic. 

The food arrives, the salad is good and fresh the main courses come and all are cooked to perfection. My medium rare T-Bone was actually medium rare for once! My steak was tender and taste fabulous. The food didn't hold it's heat well and they serve sweet potatoes or rice with the dishes rather than standard baked/mashed or fried Idaho's (extra charge for a standard potato - why? - Minus another 1/2 star). But over all it was a good meal. We barely had room for the dessert so we split a 9 layer chocolate fudge cake and another dessert among us. And we still had four or so layers of cake left to go home! It was so rich and such a huge slice no 3 people could have eaten the entire thing following a meal if they tried... 4 of us dug into this slice. 

All in all it its a great steakhouse. Prices lower than Lonestar and Steak portions (ounces) bigger for your money, plus a better all over food and appetizer menu by far. Oh yeah I'm a fan and will be returning again and again when I want a steakhouse to fill my steak cravings and a bit of entertaining to accompany the meal. 

I highly recommend Rustlers Rooste.",1
"Fantastic, order anything off the menu and you will be pleasantly surprised.  Best gyro I've ever had hands down and the falafel is equally amazing.  Owner paid special attention to my boyfriend and I and made sure we were happy with everything.  Only downside is that they close for a couple hours during the day before dinner time (I believe its 2:30 to 5:30 or something like that) so I can't eat their delicious food whenever I want, haha, keep on doing what you're doing Sahara.",1
"Yes, I'm a fan this place but it definitely does not deserve a 5 star rating.  First off lets start with the decor.  While it was very nice when it first opened it's now getting a little raggedy looking and could use some updating.  Food wise this buffet is above average and definitely worth a visit.   If I could give them some advice it would be to get rid of  the HUGE salad buffet section or at least scale it way down and put that money into even more entree selections.  I've been coming here ever since they opened and hardly ever see anyone eating off the salad section.  So why spend so much money to have such a huge selection???   Put that money into the entree selection and make this place an even better value.  And for Gods sake bring back the Mayonnaise Shrimp !!  You made one of the best versions I've ever tasted.",1
"They say its bar food done right - I'd have to say I agree.  Got the burger and wings - both very solid.  Love the beer choices.  The prices are very reasonable for specialty beer and good bar food.  All in all, I am definitely going back regularly!",1
"I went to Z Tejas with a bunch of people (about 25) last night.  We had a great experience from start to finish.  

At the beginning my lady and I were early so the waiter got us our drinks and continued to make sure we were good to go.  We wanted to wait for our friends so food wasn't necessary at this time, but the drinks were flowing and the waiter (Jeff) was very cool, friendly, and down to earth.  

All of our friends showed up and we let the good times roll.  Chips and salsa, drinks, water, and the delicious cornbread, they all came very fast and it didn't take any begging on our part.  

I got a chicken dish which was really good, I stuffed myself silly.  My lady got a side salad which was huge, she couldn't even finish it and she said it was really good.  Oh! and the food came fast by the way (surprising when you have 25 people.

The overall vibe of the place is really cool, very trendy and fancy but reasonable prices.  Big screens everywhere, gotta love that since there were some great College FB games on last night.  

Great experience, thanks Jeff & Z Tejas.",1
"Yes, it is small, yes, it takes time to get your order, but the quality of the food serve is excelent !!! Celina is the name of the owner (not Selena) of this fabulus resturant.  She takes your order, runs to the kitchen and then she serves your order too. I wouldn't say that this is a one person resturant, because she has help in the kitchen.  
Very few Mexican resturants in Phoenix serve food as good as this one. The Menu is limited but whatever you order you will not be disappointed.",1
"Yeah, it's a chain and while not haute cuisine, we had a very good meal there.  We were there on a busy Saturday night and we had great, friendly and quick service and our food was quite good.  

Not only is it a good value for the neighborhood, I thought it was downright cheap for what you get.  (It's probably roughly comparable to The Hillstone Group's Houston's or Bandera in terms of quality and service at about half the price.)  

Great salads too.

I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way for it, but it's a very reasonable choice if you happen to be at Fashion Square.

Dinner for 2 with drinks, about fifty bucks.",1
"I've tried 4-5 different reflexology places in the East Valley as well as numerous professional massage places (like Massage Envy which is much pricier and kind of hit and miss) and Relax Station is the place I'm sticking with. (See ya later Massage Envy!)

It looks unimpressive from the outside, but I like that it is very clean and unsketchy, and they have private rooms (some reflexology places I've been to put you in a huge room with like 10 other people which feels a little strange).

They've always done a great job, and the price is reasonable (30$/hour) compared to other places in the area (cheapest I've found is 28$ at other places with a coupon). They also give you a full bottle of water when you finish.

They also take walk-ins or reservations, and I've never had trouble getting in when I want to.

Relax Station has definitely become MY massage place, I usually end up going every 3 or 4 weeks.",1
"Stopped in with my two yr old granddaughter today after going to the children's museum, got some raised eyebrows when the cool people  saw the kid but whatever I had to have one of there dirty chai's. Good as usual and the kiddo had a cupcake she thoroughly enjoyed on the drive home.",1
"We went to the Science Center for their body exhibit and then walked around to find something to eat. We chose The Rose and Crown because it was close, not too fancy and the music pouring out was great. We ate out on the beautiful porch of this amazing house and although we don't drink, we were welcomed and enjoyed the experience. I asked the waiter for his dinner suggestion and went with it (fish and chips), my husband ordered the shepherds pie. Both were quite delicious. I even took the time to use the restroom and to see the inside of the restaurant and enjoyed the ambiance throughout the pub. 
I will definitely be back with friends to enjoy again.",1
"I ate here after eating at the one in San Diego a couple times.  I was a little disappointed.  The place was kind of depressing and slow moving, but I was there at 8:15 on a Tuesday.  Overall, the food wasn't that good.  I had one of the soups and it was just okay.

I would definitely be willing to give this place another shot, though.  I really liked some of the stuff at the SD location and I would like to try it here.

If you have never been to a Loving Hut, it is worth a visit to see the crazy TV channel and some of the inventive dishes.

I strongly recommend the things that look like breaded chicken legs but are really filled with mushrooms.  That thing is tasty.",0
"Being Indian, and having grown up in London, I have been pretty spoilt for Indian food. Imagine my dismay when I moved to Phoenix! I've tried many different places here in town desperately trying to recapture the memory of a good London curry house but each time I've left either disappointed or clutching my guts fearing what may come.

Couple of friends introduced me to this place a few months ago and I'm stoked. It's not as good as the stuff back home. And I'm sure you can get better in San Francisco or New York. But if you are looking for something closer to home you can't go wrong.

Plus its got the real live Indians eating in there too. Can't be bad!!",1
"Going to keep this review short and to the point...

Service: Most of the time horrible. Typical waiting forever at the bar for a drink, if I can even get thru to the bar... Bartenders seem to be oblivious to serving patrons in a fair first-come-first serve fashion...Major dislike

Atmosphere: Trendy and hip. Except for the excessive desperate looking cougars trying to cash in on fake rich or really young ripped Jersey Shore looking guys. The cougars are just minor annoyances, they don't get in the way too much. The majority of the people seem to be pretty cool though.

Pricing: A little steep, but it's Scottsdale. The place could offer a better happy hour. Sunday's bottomless bubbles (champagne) is a great value. 

Food: Portions are pretty small, but are decently priced.

Decor: Outstanding! Job well-done in decorating and furnishing the place. It's really distinctive and luxurious. However, the rough plastic-feeling purple couches do not feel pleasant to the touch. They look like velvet, but are vinyl. Major fail on this! This requires immediate attention.

Patio: Great views and plenty of seating. However, hated how many stupid old smelly cigar smokers were out there clogging up the air. I'm not sure what can be done about these disgusting people, but overall the patio set up is one of the best around...",1
"BYOB and you can get a flaming boat of sushi?! #winning

This is an awesome neighborhood place with reasonable prices and delicious menu options. Plus, it's BYOB - a rarity it seems.

I attended with a party of four and we spent about $110 and were stuffed on tons of food. The noodle dishes and sushi were great and our server was a lot of fun.",1
"Went here for lunch today (Wasn't feeling the hot pocket I had in the freezer here at work) 

What can I say. Its Subway. Its consistently mediocre. Its not overly fantastic, but its not knock me on my ass terrible. 

Subway is kinda like Olive Garden for me...some times you just need mediocre food. I don't know why it is...and maybe I am the only weirdo... But one thing is for certain, it always tastes the same every time I go there. Maybe it has that high school nostalgia for me. I dunno. I also like stail Necco waffers, so maybe dont pay attention to any of my reviews. 

I get the Spicy Italian, on cheese bread (duh), provolone cheese, light mayo, mustard, lettuce, cucumbers, olives, onions, peppers and LOTS of banana peppers, S&P. That's how I roll.",0
"Here last night with friends. We had to wait a little longer to be seated than I would have liked but we were a party of five so I understand. Once we were seated service was quick and pleasant. We shared a couple of the flatbreads to start, so by the time we ordered entrees I was already pretty full and went with a salad, the strawberry balsamic, which was delicious and just made me feel all ready for summer. We were there quite a while talking and enjoying our meal, and the staff never made us feel hurried although it was a pretty busy night. We tipped well enough that I don't feel bad about taking up space for that long, that's something I always make sure to do in that situation.",1
"I went here this morning for breakfast with the BF to use our living social deal. We had been to black bear before about 6 years ago in glendale and then again maybe 4 years ago up in Washington state. The last time we went, we were not terribly thrilled with the place. Anyway, we decided to give them another shot and it was pretty decent. I had the shasta scramble, which has avocado, onion, bell pepper, and spinach. This was good, it was not the most flavorful scramble I have ever had, but the veggies were fresh and I liked that this was an option on their menu because most places only have one veggie scramble and it has tons of veggies thrown in with no reason for those veg to go together...anyway, the breakfast came with a ton of country potatoes which I liked more than the typical hash brown. The BF got the one biscuit and gravy breakfast and he said it was alright, not the best ever, but not bad. I thought breakfast here was better than Denny's or Ihop, but clearly not as good as the Farmhouse or Liberty Market and the like of local breakfast places. The service was also good, but I thought it was so weird because our waitress kept calling us 'kids' and calling me sweetie, princess, and honey. I find this somewhat condescending, not that I think that was her intention, but I think that is unnecessary. I know this is kind of a diner thing, but I have never really cared for us, but maybe that's just me. The waitress was good at her job and attentive though, so that is what's important. Also, the portions are huge and I wish they had more options for half meals because I don't like to waste food, but I know people like the giant portion thing.... I would probably come back here for breakfast again sometime, however, because it is decently priced and has decent flavor.",0
"confirmed better than subway blimpie quiznos etc etc

Not really much else to say that hasnt been said above. Wished they had more vegetarian options :(",1
"I was told to see Greg after a local shop diagnosed my exhaust problem.  He took a few minutes to look at my car, told me what I needed and what it would cost. I went back a week later, he did the work in the time he told me it would take and there was no surprises and my car is doing well. I would recommend this place over ANY muffler shop. Plus you support local business and not a chain.",1
"Cherry on Top is a rare example of design by market analysis committee, who couldn't decide on a unique concept so they decided to ""borrow"" from all of their competitors' styles, turning out at least as well as if not better than its individual inspirations.

The result provides convenient answers to the following frozen yogurt questions:
- Can't decide between tart and traditional? Why not both?
- Can't decide between standard or high-end sweet? Mix vanilla, taro, green tea, cheesecake (but only at your own risk.)
- Feeling constrained by four fit all sizes? $0.39/oz., cup weight subtracted.
- Wavering on the topping healthiness spectrum? Fruit to sugar cereal to nuts to crushed big brand candy available.

The quality is close enough to most of the relevant rivals (as long as one is not requiring the desert honey Sweet Republic tart variant) but, correctly and perhaps intentionally, the value proposition is that most patrons won't care about the slight dip, trading off for the flexibility of purchasing (only) as much yogurt and toppings as desired while satisfying Hershey's-acclimated children with a Frankenstein of saccharine flavors and junk toppings as well guests from the city pining for the nearest Pinkberry with original tart plus kiwi, strawberries, blackberries and pineapple.",0
"Oh dang! This place is GOOD. I am in love with the carnitas burrito, and the employees are so nice and make some damn good food. If you're in the area and don't want Taco Bell then GO HERE! They also give you chips, and the chips and salsa are pretty legit. Try not to stuff yourself with the chips though, cause the foods the real winner here. I will be back, and have been back many many times since my first experience. Why only 4 stars you ask? The breakfast burrito was just a-okay, I would much rather get a breakfast burrito elsewhere but the regular burritos are the bomb diggity! ;)",1

"So, I've been going to to Allure for pedi's for about a year.  They're located very close to my house so it's mainly been a convenience thing.  The techs are hit and miss.  Some are awesome and really do a good, thorough job. But overall its usually a pretty neutral experience.  The last couple of times I went in they were just rude.  The girl who did my last pedi  (about 2 weeks ago) got rude when I wouldn't accept her upsales......did a sloppy job on my polish and wouldn't fix a mistake when she made when she slipped on my flip flop.  On Thursday (NY eve) I went in for a mani....the sloppiest mani I have EVER had.  She soaked my right hand for all of 10 seconds before starting my cuticles.  When I flinched when she cut my finger she slammed her tools on the table, grabbed the water bowl that my left hand was still in (slopped water), stood up and said, ""No manicure, polish change"".  When she came back, I tried to explain I did want a manicure, not only a polish change.  She raised her voice and said that I was too jumpy ""Everything hurt you"".  Well, she did my polish....horrible job!! About 1/4"" from my cuticle....it looked just dreadful.  While I was waiting for my polish to dry there was a man giving another women a pedi......she told him 3 times (!!!) he was hurting her and he just laughed and said ""it tickles""??  She said NO, it HURTS.  I'm done with this place.  There are plenty of these cookie cutter shops around.....They need to re-check their customer service skills.  This was just wrong!!",2
Delishhhh... blueberry crepes w/cream cheese!,1
"I had a lot of fun playing this course today with my 12-year old son (who hits in the low 100s.)  We also played this course back in November when we were here in town and had an equally enjoyable time.

The course is in great shape and we were able to finish our round in around 4-5  hours.  The staff here are very friendly and accommodating and the beverage cart came by around 5 times during our round.  The price they gave us (as return out-of-towners) for a Sunday morning tee-time was incredible - 2 adults at $89 each + $40 rental + FREE junior fees + $15 junior rental.  Other similar quality local courses wanted to charge full fees for juniors for the same tee time, so I really appreciated the gesture. If they keep this policy in tact, this will be my regular course when my son and I come back in town.

As for the course, the early holes are typical resort style holes followed by 5 or so residential public course-style holes. The beauty of this course is the back-9 desert-style holes that wrap around into the south mountain before returning back into the resort with the final par-3 that provides a breath taking semi-panoramic view of the valley from downtown Phoenix to the Superstition Mountains.  I found the back-9 to be short, but very technical, constantly testing my course management abilities - i.e, thought I could hit onto the green (from the whites) on every par-4, but came up short every time.

Would definitely recommend this course for other out-of-towners like me who want to get in a quick round on a nice course.  The pro shop is  small but well-stocked.  The restaurant has patio seating overlooking the first tee and serves some decent food.  However, they need to get better beers on tap (IPAs and microbrews would be nice!.)",1
"We had our work holiday party here and we can't wait to come back and enjoy it again. We were greeted with a large wine selection and some appetizers on a back patio. The appetizers were mini pizza/bruschetta - some had mushrooms and some has tomatoes with cheese. Both were delicious. Another appetizer was a date wrapped in bacon - this was super delicious and easy to eat. I ordered a pineapple mojito and at first our server was confused, saying they don't have a blender but could make us a raspberry mojito. (I've had bartenders tell me they don't have blenders when I've ordered mojitos before, so I was used to this.) Luckily, our server came back later telling me she was confused and viola a delicious pineapple mojito was placed in my hands with a large slice of pineapple on the rim. It was amazing! So good, the husband had to order one for himself. Our party moved inside to a private room where we were given tiny menus with simple selections. The husband ordered the beef entree, steak with horseradish mashed potatoes and I ordered the scallops with corn polenta. While the scallops were delicious, the steak was super tender and moist! (Better than a fillet we had the night before!) For desert, I ordered the chocolate cake with coffee crema inside and the husband ordered the cheesecake. The cheesecake came in a cute mason jar and was amazing. I really liked my chocolate cake but the cheesecake was better. For once everything the husband ordered was better than what I had ordered! It was a fantastic party and such a great venue. Can't wait to come back!",1
"This is a decent place to go see various types of electronic dance music.  It's not an insane place that will make you want to vomit or gouge out your eyes (i.e., Myst, et al).  The times I've been here, the people here seem pretty decent, though there is the share of ridiculous folks. 

The bar service generally isn't very good, and you can expect to wait a while to get a drink.  The place is pretty small, so if you're seeing a big act, you will be tightly packed and wait a while to get upstairs (one up - one down when filled).  And be wary, you're liable to get second-hand pepper sprayed from one of the neighboring bars/clubs.  The bathrooms are small, and the Men's has no door on the stall (gee, I wonder why...).

On the plus side, the music is usually good, and they stay open past 2AM (wtf is with you people and ""liquor laws""?).",0

"I wouldn't write a review on a franchise unless it pissed me off. I prefer Papa John's pizza to Dominos or Pizza Hut (by far), but there are some major service issues that have made my five ordering experiences pretty irritating.

They can't find my house. It's not hard to find, I swear. It's a piece of cake, and a stone's throw from a major crossroad. They had once taken two hours to deliver a pizza, saying they tried to call me (they didn't), only to return to the store and bring it back once I called. Naturally, I was delivered a lukewarm pizza, but in the nicest way possible was told that it was *my* mistake.  Unacceptable, in the age of online ordering and GPS systems in our phones, there is no excuse for getting lost in what is essentially a three mile drive in a straight line. 

Without complaining, I had received a coupon for a free large pizza. Apology accepted. Upon visiting the store, I got to keep the card *after* ordering because they gave me the wrong toppings. Suckers.

Also, they always take longer than the ETA, even in the middle of a weekday. Even now, I am waiting 70 minutes for a 30-40 minute order, and when I had called 15 minutes ago, was told it was on its way, but that construction was holding it up. Yes, there is construction, but you have taken this long in the past without it. Also, construction would not explain why it takes nearly an hour to produce one large pizza. I even tip nicely.

I enjoy Papa John's pizza, but unless my complaints are addressed, I will never order from this location again. I will encourage my friends to follow suit. RAWR.",2
"The interior is very industrial and charming; furnished with iron beams, brick walls and simple hanging lightbulbs. The lobby area has special imported drinks and other trinkets. There is always a line but it usually goes pretty quick because you're distracted by all of their deserts and miscellaneous goodies on display. I've never had a meal that wasn't awesome here. I usually find myself eating the simple but delicious Liberty Joe with their special spicy sauce and then finishing the meal off with a home-made snicker-doodle. Whatever you end up ordering, I'm sure you'll end up enjoying Liberty Market as greatly and as frequently as I do!",1

"Standing like a paragon of virtue in a sea of decadence, U.S. Egg's Scottsdale's location is place of redemption, both for your soul and your appetite. Open only for breakfast and lunch, the restaurant attracts as diverse a clientele as the 'dale itself. This is not somewhere that relies on being a tourist trap: some locals are known to eat here daily.

Its location is slightly outside the Old Town Pale, but still within walking distance unless it's the height of summer. Secondly, it has its own parking lot, making it as accessible as Denny's or a Marie Callendars. Nevertheless the lot is often full on weekend mornings, and you will definitely see people waiting. unless you arrive very early or late. There is both an outdoor patio seating area and a large indoor dining room.

Having gone numerous times alone, I am always impressed how quickly I am seated. No bias against tables for one here. The servers are all personable and graceful...yet not self-aggrandizing. This is not a Michelin four-star restaurant however, and you should not expect being waited on hand and foot. Given the volume of service, it's also commendable how few mistakes are made and how prompt everything is.

The food is also excellent. Although you can order both lunch or breakfast, I tend to crave the latter more. There's plenty of variety on the menu and they have both innovative dishes and old staples. This helps to explain why the uber-fab Scottsdale club kids patronize this place just as much as the Cadillac set. Prices are very reasonable for Scottsdale, though perhaps too much for a dirt-poor college student or person living only on Social Security.

The building also capitalizes on Arizona's sunny weather with high ceilings and plenty of windows...causing plenty of light to splash in and helping to evoke that sense of morning and freshness. There's plenty of ambient noise as a result...but it's almost reassuring. Not to mention that the hearing-aid crowd and club crawlers may be too deaf to notice.

U.S. Egg is not flawless, however. From a cost point of view, the restaurant has to contend with the fact that breakfast is usually the cheapest meal of the day. Without a dinner menu though to recoup cost, diners have to grin and bear any perceived cost imbalance from say  Denny's. Neverthless it's still worth it, in my opinion. The other shortcoming stems from the food. Different dishes often rely on the same sides. If you get sick of their potatoes for example, you can be really out of luck despite ordering something different every time. Moreover their signature dishes again may not impress truly demandng foodies.

While it may not cure your hangover (or incontinence), U.S. Egg remains firmly on the map for locals. Managing to please all of Scottsdale is a tall order, and the owners, managers, and staff all should stand tall and be proud.",1
"Copper Star is a great example of adaptive use in the heart of the Melrose curve. Who would have thought that a building initially designed to provide fuel to cars would so work so well serving fuel to humans?

Their coffee is locally roasted and, while not my favorite, is well above average in Phoenix. Their drive-thru is a great feature for those mornings when I'm running late. For the coffee adverse, Copper Star serves chai, tea, smoothies, Italian sodas, and some unique drinks including a black cherry limeade. Foodwise, there is a wide selection of baked goods,including some of the best bagels. They also have decent lunch offerings, such as sandwiches and a tasty hummus platter. But where they shine is their 'home baked' cupcakes. (I've seen Mayor Gordon here on several occasions getting his cupcake fix!) 

Despite being in a converted gas station/garage, the atmosphere is quite a bit more cozy than most of the other coffee shops in central Phoenix. While the sandblasted block walls and exposed ceiling let that building's industrial past peak through, this is offset by rotating art work and selection of comfortable (if a bit dingy) couches and easy chairs as well as small bistro tables and long 'work' tables to choose from. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the owner, Bill, is a great neighborhood resource. He can tell you anything and everything going on along 7th Ave.

All in all a good place to grab a coffee and cupcake,  meet a friend or get some old fashioned reading done. I can't recommend it for serious work requiring internet access, however, as the wifi access remains intermittent at best.",1
"Tonight was my second time dining at Yasu's. I was really excited to score a seat at the sushi bar, eagerly hoping to chat it up w/ the sushi chefs. However, they seemed too flustered w/ all the orders that they made a minimal attempt to talk to me besides asking, ""is everything ok?"" And I think the Mexican sushi chef is new so the Japanese sushi chef had to instruct him on certain things a few times. 

I started off w/ an order of kampachi sushi, per one of the recommendations of the Japanese sushi chef. While it tasted fresh, it was very blah to me... nothing special about it at all. 

A few minutes later, the waitress arrived to take my drink order. I decided to just stick w/ water and told her I was ready to order a few items off the paper menu. I had decided on mirugai (giant clam/geoduck) w/ mixed mushrooms, hamachi sashimi w/ jalapenos and ribeye sumibiyaki. First up was the hamachi sashimi w/ jalapeno slices. Nice thick slices of buttery hamachi, but all the seeds were scraped out of the jalapeno slices so they weren't packing much heat. After I ate them all, I remembered that there's a freakin recall on jalapenos in AZ and there wasn't a sign in the restaurant stating that their jalapenos are safe. JUST. EFFIN. GREAT. I hope I don't get salmonella. If you don't hear from me in a few days, pls call for help.. I live alone! And tell them, IT WAS THE JALAPENOS FROM YASU'S THAT DID ME IN!

Anyhow, next up was the mirugai w/ mixed mushrooms dish. Very small portion, but it was tasty. They were a bit skimpy on the mirugai to mushroom ratio so that was a little disappointing. About 10 minutes later, the waitress asks if I'm all done.. I ask her about the ribeye and she asked the sushi chef & kitchen in a frantic tone.. They reassured us it was almost ready. Another 10 mins later, it arrives.. I guess it was worth the wait.. it was soo tender I was able to ""cut"" off the fat w/ my chopsticks. DEEE-FREAKIN-LISH. It could have used a lil salt, but that's just me being picky. The 3 sweet dipping sauces helped. Next time, I wanna try the duck sumibiyaki. 

Since I had a $50 gift card (that I purchased from the radio promos for $25), I had another $10 to use up so I ordered the shrimp skewers wrapped in crispy noodles. The crispy noodles were like deep fried chow mein noodles. Interesting, but good. 

Stuffed like a pig, I paid and waddled out w/ my leftovers in tow.",1
"They close earlier than most large book retailers, 10pm ... Major bummer for those who like to hit up a bookstore late at night instead if the club! Lol.

"If Star of India (SoI) is named after the historic ship that set sail from Great Britain to India then it is best to declare at the beginning that there is nothing worth remembering about this place and there is little that keeps you afloat in the morass of ordinary fare. 

Like many other Indian restaurants in the valley, the smell of Indian cooking hangs in the air and permeates every piece of furnishing. The place does not disappoint when it comes to service, it is warm, quick and attentive. The complimentary papadums (Indian flatbread) with homemade chutneys (condiments) is usually the high point of a meal at SoI. 

Experiences with the order could be as follows: 
Gobi Parantha (Indian bread stuffed with cauliflower)- The real thing is meant to be fluffy and served with butter but the SoI parantha resembles a topping-less thin crust pizza. 
Lamb korma- The gravy is thick, nutty with a lot of authentic flavours but the meat tastes pre-cooked. 
Chicken biriyani- it is difficult to describe the God-food that is biryani but SoI manages to serve a new variation which is nothing more than chicken pieces thrown into a mishmash of rice and vegetables. 
Disheartenment with the over-priced, sub-standard food could lead to a decision of not ordering dessert. 

Finally, as observed in other reviews and the menu, if you visit this place then stick with the tandoori stuff and Chef's specialities. However in that case the excitement of an extensive menu will be lost.",0
"I don't know what else to say that hasn't already been said! I went here for my birthday and it was such a nice and special occasion. Having Christopher cook for you and talk to you is such a unique dining experience and I wasn't disappointed. 

However! I would have appreciated being told to have cash up front. Also, it got really smokey in the restaurant (it is so small) and everyone's eyes were tearing up towards the end of the meal. 

I would recommend this place to anyone!",1
"I love Tasty Kabob!  Their food is always excellent, and I try to make it back there whenever I return to the Valley.  I always order their chicken shish kabob entree, which comes in a generous portion that includes rice and grilled vegetables.  The chicken is always tender, well-marinated, and equally well-seasoned.  Their beef shish kabob entree is also very good. Try shaking a little sumac spice onto the rice and meat for some extra flavor, or just enjoy it as is.  It's difficult to choose from their list of appetizers and side dishes, but their hummus is always creamy and smooth, and I love their shirazi salad.  Their spicy beans dish, however, is, by far, my personal favorite, and I always make sure to order it.  Just as important as the food is the friendly service I encounter whenever I visit.  The couple who own the restaurant always make you feel welcome.  Good food and service that makes you feel at home, what more can you ask for?  Simply put, Tasty Kabob is one of the best.",1
"I'm just glad that they brought back the Strawberry ""fields"" salad.  Yummo!  Fresh greens, goat cheese, fresh strawberries, bell peppers, onions, glazed pecans, chicken and this amazing viniagrette dressing! Wowwy Mowwy!  Oh, and it comes with a crusty buttery cheesy bread.  I have had a few run ins with bad waiter service, but the manager was always quick to come by our table to ask if anything else was needed.  As long as I get what I ordered and I dont have to poke around their tables to make ""eye contact"" with my server I'm ok.  They know they will get a mideocre tip if their service is so-so.  It's on them.  My mother got a red velvet cupcake on the house for her birthday! That was nice.",1
Dr. Jones was very friendly and understanding!,1
"Are you one who likes the smell of a brand new car? How about the smell, or in this case, lack of smell, of a brand new gym? Now, for a limited time, a completely unsullied 24 Hour Fitness, at the MetroCenter, of all places.

At its current new state (it's been open for a week), this 24 Hour is in much better condition than the one on Camelback. No surprise there - everything inside here is brand spanking new.

The details:

* In contrast to other 24 Hours in the Valley, this one actually will remain open 24/7 (versus closing at night on the weekends). The guy at the front desk said this is due to how this location is zoned vs the other ones.

* The cardio area is equipped with 11 flatscreen TVs hanging from the ceiling, with one even tuned into soccer-centric GolTV (which means one less tuned to all those talking heads on brainless cable news stations - bonus). 

* The adjoining weight area is larger than the Camelback location and currently has all its dumbbells in place on the correct shelves, and all its weight machines are working. No new types of machines, though (this is a 24 Hour Fitness after all) but still all the standards, plus four flat benches and four incline benches.   

* Full basketball court (which could also be split into two half-sized courts). Camelback lacks this.

* Large stretch/ab area which also includes some contraption straight out of Tron/Blade Runner. I stood there and looked at all the diagrams, acknowledged that it must be useful, and walked away.

* Standard group X classroom, childcare

* A spotless pool area. If you've been to many 24 Hour Fitness, you'll know that this is a hugely appreciated factor. I anticipate it's not going to remain spotless for long, but doing laps in a crystal clear pool was awesome. No dankness here (yet). 

* Spotless lockerroom with wood-paneled lockers and branded Dial Ultimate Clean hair & body wash. I'm assuming the women's lockerroom has their own corporate soap sponsor (I find all this a little odd, but go figure).  But beyond soap, there's some contraption called SuitMate which is like a salad spinner for your swim trunks. Just throw your trunks inside it, press down, and in 30 seconds your trunks are water-free. How awesome is that?

* Is going here after work safe for your car, you ask? Well, when I left the gym two hours later at around 9:45 pm, my car was still there in the parking lot, untouched. Seems like the MetroCenter is full of surprises.

* All in all, a great gym that I'm sure will be a welcome addition to the area. However, it still rates 4 stars since:

A) Although all the equipment is brand new and the latest edition of everything, there is fitness equipment at other gym chains that this one is lacking. 

B) I'm anticipating what the gym will be like in 6 months. If it manages to stay as clean as it is now by that time, maybe a 5th star will be in order.",1
"Good food and able to manage a large group easily. Our party had 11 and there wasn't a long wait at all. Highlights: spinach and artichoke dip, onion rings, and tortilla soup. Total tab was only $160 for the whole group.",1
"Vegetarian/Vegan south Indian buffet!  Guilt free conscience! What more could a girl want? I am in LOVE with the dosas.  I always wish I had a larger tummy to accommodate all the delicious food. Udupi is proof that being vegan/vegetarian can be tasty and cruelty-free. Humble ambiance, no fancy decorations.",1
"I was only here for one night on 9/7, but I was very pleased with my stay.  The place is beautiful, the rooms are big, and the people at the front desk were pleasant and efficient.

The only down side to my stay was that I lost water pressure in the shower Friday night.  Fortunately, it was only brief.  Other than that, I enjoyed my stay.  This will be my base of operations for my next visit.

As for others' comments that there isn't anything nearby - That's what cars are for.  Last I heard you can rent them here and there.",1
"I really dig this place!  But I have to say, every 3rd or 4th visit to this restraunt is a miss.  Not sure why- but it is most of the time spot on.  I love the Pho- but the noodle dishes are what is off.  

Either way, the owners are super sweet and nice and it usually is never too busy.  Service is good, carry out is great as well.  Just be careful in the noodle dish category, becuase if your really hungry, (in my experience) it may miss the mark.  Order pho to be safe!",1
"Reasons to Heart: Breakfast All Day, Self-Serve Coffee, Modern Hip Decor, NYT, Cholula, Inter-generational Friendly

Reasons You May Dislike: BUTTER PARTY, Small Menu, Awkward Market, Bizarre Combo of Self-Serve/Service that is NOT Apparent, Kid Friendly

Reasons to Be Here: Your friends you lost to baby-making Suburbs, IKEA, You are Near the I-10 and Do Not Feel like Sushi, Ace Hardware, You want B-fest after 10:30am on a Weekday, Dad Wants Burger, you Want Organic Local yogurt/parfait

First time here with my friend's parents, as we walked up, I noticed an antique wooden bench with multiple kinds of newspapers, including NYT, held down by an old iron and an Open sign with neon on a skateboard. Whoa. What a liberal hip person coding of an entrance if I ever saw one! Inside, a bright modern airy space with concrete floors, exposed ceiling beams, bright green walls and exposed stainless steel industrial kitchen, I was super impressed by the brightness the huge windows gave the place as well as the cutting edge furniture. The menus are charming chalkboard options that have breakfast all day, kid's menu and lunch served after 11am. All priced between $4-$11, alas there are vegetarian options but this is NOT a butter free place. In fact, it is a fucking BUTTER PARTY. So get your LacTaid if you can do it!

The slightly hipster staff (the guys look like that dude who played Keats in Bright Star) are amiable at the counter but after ordering my garden veggie sammie I was dismayed to realize they had pastry cases hidden in the counter (you just basically look up the whole time then realize after swiping your debit card your other options). Also the drink menu is awkwardly displayed to the far right of the main menus (um, I would've wanted a soy latte instead of coffee...). After paying at the register, there is the bizarre scramble of figuring out what you have to get yourself.

There is a large bevy cooler that has wine, beer, soda, juice, water, etc and was a very healthy selection (not a poor one at all). Awkwardly placed is the water, iced tea and coffee station where people are trying to read the menu before ordering. Most tables are four person tables with two people seating around the windows and large community tables towards the L-shaped back, along with bar/counter seating that views the cooks station. Each time I went I ended up at the same four-person table near the condiment table stocked w/catsup, Sriracha, Cholula hot sauce (oh shit). 

My first experience I got ginger beer and a veggie sandwich. Now, as a vegetarian for over 12 years, and a lactose-intolerant for over 5 years, my expectations were way low. Instead, I was fucking IMPRESSED. The bread ended up soggy due to the herbs mayonaisse cream dill sauce thing with incredible local roasted veggies with really good bread. OMFG. I mean seriously, I can't remember much of the meal cause my brain went somewhere spiritual. I also got the fresh fruit on the side, and a great deal with fresh berries, grapes, kiwi, etc. I managed to fit it all in my tummy (and felt def. overstuffed-I should've kept 1/2 of it). My companions had the pulled pork sandwich and killed it, the other had pancakes.

Today, I woke up and I wanted breakfest. Not Essence, Gallo Blanco, Lux, Wildflower, def. NOT Harlows, I wanted fancy pants American style breakfast I hadn't had a billion times before. Located right off the I-10, it's a fast drive from Tempe, and I didn't know what to expect for a crowd around 10:30 on a Tuesday. Turns out, Tim and I were def. the median age here. Mostly older patrons, couples, families, business deals, co-workers, moms with toddlers (they have plenty of nice high-chairs, btw). I had to get the pancakes ($6) w/fruit ($1) and side of potatoes ($3) and coffee. Tim got the rotassarie chicken with grilled corn and hand cut french fries (I think under $10). Seating was easy, food came out together within 15 minutes. The pancakes were delicate, almost crepe like, with a buttermilk taste but not too cinnamony and a little dry and thin (in a good way-sops up the butter and syrup). The serving of fruit on top was a little small, but all good quality, the potatoes were home-made style with sauted onions, skins still on.  His plate was huge with a grilled corn, the fries still had the skin on, and the chicken looked great and very greasy (which he killed). We had to remember to get our own utensils, napkins, and our own drinks but the staff checked in periodically and after finishing our plates, the dirty dishes sat around for 5 minutes, I believe due to the insane lunch rush that came in! Seriously, the place exploded! I was happy Tim had bought the cookies he eyed earlier so we skidaddled after using the nice, clean bathrooms. 

Now, eating yummers Blondie cookie and chocolate chip cookies that are greased through the paper bag, I think I will have to ride my bike here to justify the butter party celebration!",1
"Average Cajun food, nothing special.  I came here late on a Tuesday night.  Few people there.  It's a dive of a place in a strip mall.  A bluesman was playing nice quiet blues on an electric guitar...very nice.  Kinda scruffy place with all the basic Cajun staples.  Nothing fancy.  Decent brews.  I think the bar tender was waiting tables.  I probably won't be back, but I had heard it was great and wanted to try it.  I think I like more upscale digs and fancier/pricier fare.",0
"Great Korean Kalbi and other table top meats.
rest of the dishes wasn't that impressive .
Weekend could be really busy you might need to wait for a while to get your food.
but weekdays pretty slow.
If you like Korean BBQ, this is the best place in chandler ,gilbert area.",1
"What a cool little place tucked away behind a strip mall.  Would never have found this if it was not suggested by a good friend who raved about the cappuccino!  He is world traveler, so, it's a  must try if it's the best cup he's ever had.  He was right!  Don't know if it's in the beans or the care that they take to make it with a fab froth decoration on top.  My hubby and I loved the caramel brulee taste..  My son loved the hot ""warm"" cocoa.  Yeah, we walked in as a family last night and almost everyone turned our way since we did not fit the hip college crowd.  Everyone was really friendly, though. The sweet young man behind the counter gave my son some micro cinnamon doughnuts and scored major points with the little dude!   We will be back.",1
"my husband and i LOVE this place! 

no, we cannot afford to get our weekly groceries here (although it would be terrific if we could), but we view oakville as an excellent alternative to dining out on the weekend. 

the food is delicious (think deli, simplicity, quality ingredients), and the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing! we found that if it's too crowded inside, then it's easy enough go outside to the awesome patio area to enjoy our beer and goodies :)",1
"Healing hands!  A dedicated, professional  therapist/intricate bodyworker who listens to your needs to develope an individualized treatment.  Focused in addressing  my health concerns and goals.  A message like no other that left me  feeling restored with the added bonus of ""spot on"" nutritional advise ... an overall concern for your good health!   To feel renewed ... highly recommended!!!!!!!!",1
"I see a few of the previous reviews discussing issues with service, but I have always had good service at this place.  I have only been in a handful of times, but we never have to wait very long to be helped, and the staff is very friendly.
I have only ordered salads there, but I've enjoyed the three that I've tried (Maggie's, Jamaican Jerk Chicken, and Greek).  The salad dressing always comes on the side, which is perfect, because that is how I like to order salads (so I can control the amount of dressing.)  My husband loves the pulled pork, although it's popular and sells out pretty quickly from our experience.",1
"Great food at reasonable prices in a good atmosphere. 

Our family has been regulars for over seven years at the W. Iron location. The food is fantastic, you can't beat it for breakfast and the lunch sandwiches are great. We've noticed a big difference in the staff since managment changed. Many of the new servers are not as attentive as they should be but the long time servers never disappoint. 

If you go on the weekend prepare to wait, sometimes up to an hour. On Sunday if you arrive before 9:30 the wait isn't that long.",1
I read about Scramble on line so I thought I would go there for brunch and I loved it!! The Santa Fe eggs Benedict are amazing! The staff is friendly and the ambiance is incredible. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!!!,1
"Great sushi, not so great on speed. Cute place, friendly staff. Try the Vegie Goyza, it is great. Sushi rolls are a bit large for one bite. Asked if we wanted a Tea refill as we were leaving. Huh?",0
"Went here because of a groupon, will probably not go back without one.  

Cons:
Overpriced, flat out.  Plus, like other reviewers have said, they RUN OUT of a lot of good stuff.  Also, I know this is something small, but as their menu changes, they should update it online.  Had I known the menu would be so different, I would have waited for another week to get a meal I would ACTUALLY want (as opposed to settling).  Also, we had reservations and had to wait 20 minutes.  Not a huge deal, but a personal pet peeve.

Pros:  
The food was good, but like I said, overpriced.  Since I had a deal, I didn't mind as much.  Atmosphere is nice, and I loved the extras (we got a few small tasting, palate cleansers?).  The cotton candy was fab, and though the strawberry dessert was NOT my first choice, it was truly delicious, and I may go back JUST for that dish!  I love the location, and the staff was incredibly friendly, informative, and courteous.  

Knock down the prices and I'd give it at least 4 stars!",0
"Smaller than the Chandler location, but definitely a great place to find bargains. Come here prepared to do a bit of digging (especially in the shoe section) and expect to wait in line.",1
"Most of my excitement and ""love"" of this place has more to do with what it represents -- not what it is right at this second, but I fully expect that to get better. TFM representing a place in Central Tempe to get basic groceries (all the better that they're local and organic!) without needing access to a car. 
When I looked up the location, I felt heartsick at the thought that this is right across the street from where the Co-Op used to be. What's there now? An empty dirt lot. The Co-Op was driven out by an over zealous real estate company that, in the boom of condo building, bought the location, driving Co-Op to another spot where it eventually failed. Know what else failed? That condo endeavor. Now, a few years later, we have this budding marketplace with a lot to live up to.
My first trip in, I didn't have anything particular I needed, I just wanted to check things out (though I was making enchiladas later that day, so had a few items I was on the look-out for). 
It's pretty small right now, and in the former building of Jake's Shop, which is also another Tempe staple now gone. But it had the basics such as milk, peanut butter, a small selection of produce -- local, of course -- cheese and even some gift-type items for sale in the back. 
I picked up some green onions (99 cents for a bunch) and red peppers ($1.29/ea), and thought those prices were exact with a chain grocery. And bread - this is my favorite part of the store! A big selection of sliced wheats and grains, and rolls and longer Ciabatta styles too. And the favorite of my favorite? Fresh ""Made this morning!"" tortillas! They looked delicious, and were HUGE. The size of a large pizza, they came in flavored varieties for making yummy wraps.
When I checked out ($5 minimum for credit card purchases, and a sign said ""EBT coming soon""), I was offered another red pepper from a basket by the register because this small batch was about to go bad. So instead of letting them and then throwing them away, they *give* them away with each purchase - wonderful! 
Oh, and I was surprised and pleased to see a small corner of the store set up with a couple small tables and a couch, all within view of a large flat screen playing Alice in Wonderland. Sure enough, a kid sat there, out of the way and quiet, while is parents shopped. Both parents and the childless thank the owners for THAT kid haven, I'm sure.
I really look forward to coming in again and again and watching this place grow and thrive.

p.s. I highly recommend becoming a fan of their FB page, so you can get daily info about what they just got in, specials, new additions, etc.",1
"Awesome awesome awesome!!! Our table all ordered a 5 course tasting  and it was amazing!! The flavors pop in your mouth!! Very creative chef. I don't think there was one course we were disappointed in. By the end of the 3 hour dinner we had a total of 21 courses. Each one full of flavor making you want more. The staff was excellent, always there when you need them but not hovering. I would definitely go again. Pricey but so worth it!!",1
"I love this arena...maybe I am biased since I am a diehard Suns fan and a downtown resident, but it really is a nice facility.  The Suns games are always well put together...great announcer, great dancers, great entertainment, and great concessions.

I attended the last game of the season in a suite Wednesday night and was impressed with the space and the food...actually quite good!",1
"Great hotel in Central Phoenix for a stay-cation, but not necessarily a place to stay out of town and without a car. Not much around the area, and unless you're familiar with downtown, I would rather have a guest stay in Old Town Scottsdale, etc. BUT if you do stay here, it's awesome. Great boutique rooms. Awesome pool that's happening in the summer. A GREAT rooftop patio bar, and a very very busy lobby with Gallo Blanco attached. A great place to stay, but have a car!",1
"NOTE:  I only had take-out, and it was brought to me by my boss.  She rules!
She got me a hummus/grilled/marinated chicken combo.  It has 3 different hummus...es...es (HA!): roasted red pepper, jalapeno and plain ole' hummus.  They are sectioned off in the big plastic container, which rules for my OCD, as I don't like my food touching.  In the center is a PILE (a total monton!) of grilled chicken.  It's got some sort or spicy rub on it, but not too much kick.  It had been marinated, too.  And tender....I think this is the most tender chicken I have ever had.  It made my own tender spots as juicy as the chicken was!
I'm not big on pita, so instead she got me a side of cukes.  
This thing weighs a ton and I've been eating it for 2 hours.  I have made a mess in my ""Make me Yelp"" boyshorts.",1
I love this store!  They have an amazing staff and the most modern clothes!  I set my appointments with a few of the employees and I always get compliments on my outfits when I go out!!  Hats off to the Ted Baker team in Scottsdale Fashion Square!,1
"This is the go-to place for me and and a few of my co-workers.  Why? Because it's somewhat healthy (one of my co-workers is vegetarian and they have a lot of vegan offerings) and we all love the food here.  Not everything is perfect, but the meat is always very well cooked and lean, they sometimes use too much garlic (but I like garlic) but the portions are healthy sized, and you don't have regret later for eating badly.  

The gyros here are great btw.",1
"I was hoping for a more adult friendly place. I haven't been here in years, it used to be a gay-friendly hotspot. Now it seems to caters more to families and children. I've heard the restaurant is good, but I haven't visited yet.",0
"Meh is right. This place was a big yawn for me...

I went with a group of 5 (well, 4 adults, one kiddo). This is another one of those places that tries to be fancy and pretty much sucks -- for the price and portion size anyway. We ordered beef stew, chorizo stuffed dates, halibut, cheeze sticks, chicken and white cheddar waffles, and some beers. 

First on the beers... They have Four Peaks 8th Street on tap (privately labeled as Tucks Ale or something like that) and I was happy to see this -- I love this beer. However, halfway into my meal my glass was dry and it sat that way for a good 10 minutes. If you've read any of my other yelps, you know I expect a refill promptly, especially if you expect me for forget your marginal service and mediocre food... 

When the waitress came around, she asked if I wanted another beer, I said yes. Another 10 minutes went by, me parched, growing annoyed... When she came around again it was clear she forgot all about me, then asked one of my friends if they wanted another beer -- I assertively said YES. She looked at me and proclaimed her sorrow, said it would be right up. Another 10 minutes go by, she swings by and apologizes that they had to change the keg. I understand that -- but between the FIRST and second time I asked, I watched the bartender pour another 4 or 5 8th Streets. But I didn't get one.

As for the food? Super duper BLAND. Come on Tuck's! Fancy (read expensive) food should be an explosion of complex flavor in my mouth. If I have to put table salt and pepper on it just to taste something, you pretty much suck. If we pay $30+ per person and I leave hungry, you pretty much suck. The fried chicken was pretty good, but I've had the same quality stuff from the deli at Safeway.

Overall, not impressed and see no reason to return. If you're taking a girl out on a first date who is more into atmosphere than food -- she'll probably think you are the man. But really, do you want a girl like that?",2
"The green chili  pulled pork omelet  was delightfully good.  The coffee was great, and so is the decor.  The cream chipped beef and biscuits are also pretty fantastic.",1
"Chloe's Corner, opened last week in the CityScape, Downtown.

The interior is modern, spacious and very comfortable. The design is not only admirable, but also very broad. Inside the restaurant there are various types of seating. Tables, counters even plush chairs to chill and kick it with a glass of beer or wine among friends. There is an outside patio too.

The first thing you notice during breakfast is a fifty cent cup of coffee. This is a bold brew in a paper cup and plastic top. Excellent coffee. For my morning meal I order Chloe's favorite, a six dollar 2 scrambled eggs, 2 slices of bacon, toast, wedge of fruit, plate. The swirled marbled rye bread crafted at John Anthoney's Italian Bread Company was perfect. Potatoes sauteed with fresh chili peppers were tip top. Bacon was thick and so good.

This is one of the areas newest restaurants, and even has a few groceries. Fresh ready to go pre-made lunches, fruit, wine, beer and soft drinks. I would love to recommend at least one bottle water that would come in a paper carton instead of plastic. I took home a bottle of Le Village, Sparkling French Limonade, tasty.

Also a big thanks to Malalay, a super svelte, very friendly gal that not only poured the coffee and brought the food, but laughed with me too. And ^5's to my cook.

Total bill today was $10.33. I will visit again. Happy Hour next time, to check out the beer garden.",1
"Absolutely LOVE the ambiance - very romantic with the brick and stone and walls of wine. The fireplace and comfy seating make it very intimate. In my opinion, the best time to come here is for brunch. Yes, even on a Sunday nursing a hangover, the food, drink and decor can't be beat. Very reasonably priced mimosas and bloody's as well as some of the best breakfast items you could ask. My fave is the eggs benedict with thier Mexican twist - the carne adovada is also amazing and very satisfying. No skimping on the meat here, and it's not drowning in sauce - I have yet to finish a full plate of anything. Thier potatoes even get my mouth watering.  

Service was great the last time we went, but the first time we had to go up to the bar to remind the gal we were there. After that she was more than attentive and the food more than made up for it. I could linger here for hours and get in some serious trouble! 

Have not been to the downstairs area or had any other meal here, but can't wait to go back!!!",1
"I am a Regus member and could get wait here since I could use my membership card.
Its a great place situated on 3rd floor with awesome city view. 
Complimentary menu is refreshing. Cordial staff. Quiet and relaxed environment.
Many TV screens and seatings to get comfortable with.",1
"This review is for the bar only.
I had a date last week and was looking for a local bar to grab drinks at. I called Cycle on Wednesday and was told they would be open until at least midnight on Friday, and the guy was very nice. Friday arrives, and I take my date there, and when we enter the bar, the bartender makes a gas face and says they are closed for the night. I told her that I called just two days earlier and she just stared at me. No attempt at fixing anything, nada. One drunken patron at the bar yelled to open the bar back up, but I was over it. Well done cycle.",2
"We stopped here on a Thursday night on a raving referral and they we not exaggerating - this place is fantastic!
We are always a little hesitant to try a new place when an omnivore suggests it, but as vegetarians, we found Sekong by Night so accommodating! They offered to convert nearly any dish on their menu into a vegan alternative, and it was delicious. The spring rolls are really big, and they swapped their fish dipping sauce for a vegan version. We had the Phnom Penh Noodle Soup with tofu & veggie broth (just like the Vietnamese pho!) and the Katheaw Cha rice noodles with tofu instead of beef - AMAZING. 
Service was top notch, and as many other reviewers noted their prices are unbelievably low for the quantity and quality of food that you get.
Looking forward to our next visit and trying more fantastic dishes!",1
"Tradition at it's most... er.... um.... traditional. Every time i eat here i feel like i have been transported to any number of old family owned steakhouses on the North Shore of Long Island, or Brooklyn. The plush red velvet, the dark wood and button tufted leather... The place just screams STUFFY BUSINESS LUNCH. My first experience here was with a bunch of lawyer friends who were dying for meatloaf or a steak with creamed spinach... 

The entrance is through the kitchen. That may seem a little odd, but I'd bet it sells dinners. Who can resist the wonderful aroma. By the time you reach your table, you crave rare beef, as red as the decor. 

It's the kind of place where you forgo the trendy drinks and have a Scotch with a splash,or a Rob Roy before dinner. The steaks are perfectly prepared, the garlic mashed potatoes are wonderful. I love the place. It isn't cheap, and admittedly, i have never paid for my own meal there. It has always been a treat from some friend who wears a suit to work, or some more traditional back easterner who wants to share their bit of meat and potato lovers heaven.",1
The buns fall apart so you end up eating your burger with a soggy bun.  Staff does not seem to know what is going on and they are not well trained.  Can't think on their own.,2
"I can only vouch for the chicken salad, as it's the only thing I've ever tried in the 20 years I've been coming here. It's THAT good. I always think about trying something else, but why mess with perfection?

Walking inside gives you the sense that you've stepped into a time machine and arrived in the late 70's. I, personally, find it to be awesome. Most of Scottsdale is lacking in historic flare. And yes, the late 70s is historic by Scottsdale standards. Besides, whatever money they're not spending on updating the decor is clearly going right into their magically delicious chicken salad.",1
"As many other people have said in other reviews, Betito's is similar to Filibertos.  However, I thought Betitos tasted a little better.  The food was less greasy than Filibertos.  My family had Carne asada burrito, carnitas burrito, a chicken chimichanga, and the super nachos.  They all tasted excellent.  My favorite was the carnitas burrito.  Now, Betitos offers one dollar tacos on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.  I haven't tried their tacos yet, but I intend to try them in the future.",1
"My husband and I went to Ernie's a few weeks ago on a Saturday night because it is within walking distance to our house and there is always a crowd so we wanted to check it out. We met our friends in the bar and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited. Still no-one offered to take our drink order. 

The bartenders and barbacks made eye contact but no-one came near us. We don't look like hooligans or ruffians or anything so it was irritating. The weird thing was there were people eating in the booths around us, and one or two other people at the bar (who had drinks.) We finally got up and left. Why waste money on places that won't take it! I won't return and will recommend my friends don't either!",2
"Canteen is my new favorite happy hour spot. You can get two orders of wonderful pork and habanero tacos, two orders of their tender ribs, an order of quite good chips and guacamole and a couple of margaritas for around twenty bucks, it's amazing. Add in the cool atmosphere and HUGE selection of tequilas(all half off during happy hour) and you have a recipe for success. Canteen is a very welcome addition to Mill Ave, and while it can get very loud, you simply cannot go wrong during happy hour.",1
Who the heck doesn't love huge amounts of toilet paper and free samples of food... come on now!,1
"Yoli's has recently been popping up on Yelp's 'Best Of' front page. Many people are mouthing out and as the food whore that I am, I needed to go out and try it for myself.

My previous research told me that there were many 5 stars and 3 stars reviews regarding the ambiance, service and food. It seemed that the place had be 5-stars for a while but trending analysis showed a decline in the late 2011- early 2012. Alright enough nerd talk-  it was a Saturday morning, I was starving and I needed a place to have brunch with my lady friend in town.

When it comes to brunch at Yoli's, you really need to leave all your expectations at the door. The neighborhood its in is a little sub-par, the parking situation isn't grand and the interior and patio decor resembles a home that stopped paying for landscaping services a long time ago. The tables outside are all basic basic plastic, they are not squeaky clean (or perfectly leveled) and the seating is pretty limited. If you are coming to Yoli's, you are coming here for the food and nothing else, this ain't no brunch at the Four Seasons.

Their menus are strictly breakfast/brunch related but at a 2-sided page list, their breakfast choices do have a large variety of flavors and prices. The food is on the stealthier side with skillet dishes, omelets and diner-style potato sides. My friend and I ordered their most popular dish, the El Monte- Hawaiian french toast sandwich filled with egg whites, turkey, bacon and cheese with a 'spicy orange marmalade'. At about $7, the sandwich was pretty large and filled me up easily after just half of it. The french toast itself was soft and spongy and the bacon had some crisp, but the turkey was very thinly-sliced deli meat so it didn't have a lot of flavor and the spicy marmalade was tasty but not spicy at all.

The service was a tad slow but the lady was very very courteous and nice to us, she just didn't stop by very often so we had to wait around for our drinks and our check for quite a while. Overall I wasn't blown away with Yoli's but I would recommend as a place with decent portions and good prices. As of now, a 3.75 stars on my book.

I am a big supporter of local restaurants and I love seeing a family-owned business thrive. With a little bit more decor, faster service and a cleaner environment this place can return to be the GEM that people used to talk about. Yoli, if you are reading this- I hope you take this advice, we all want to see you succeed so we hope you can get back on that horse and impress the hell out of us. Good Luck!!",1
"This place is great to go to for a chill and low key atmosphere.

You can play billiards, cornhole, or video blackjack. 

One thing I didn't like: one of the bartenders told me there is a $10 minimum to use my credit card and I think he was trying to hustle me because when I went back to close my tab (without buying another drink), the other bartender took my credit card.

Otherwise, a nice chill place to go.",1
"Do not go to this car wash. I dropped my kids off at choir and thought I'd run in for a quick car wash. Oh no! They locked my keys in the car. I couldn't get On-Star to unlock my Suburban because it was under a huge canopy and couldn't get a signal. Instead of calling a locksmith, the car washers tried and tried to get in through the window. Thankfully my husband was able to leave work early, go retrieve the kids from choir practice, and then come rescue me at the car wash with a spare set of keys. I was trapped there over an hour!  The manager then had the audacity to get mad at me because I was upset at their incompetence. They didn't even comp the car wash!  If you go here, don't pay for your car wash until your car is done!",2
"I get a call on Thursday: ""Dude, I just got fired from UOP, we have to celebrate!"" If it was from anyone else but Ryan, I would have been shocked. However, he hated his job and we love Yard House, so I was definitely down to have some ""FU UOP"" drinks up at Desert Ridge.

Yard House has been one of our main spots for years. Right off the bat, the Happy Hour is fantastic; 100+ beers on tap, including some of AZ's finest and a couple amazing international brews. The servers usually do a great job of suggesting drinks as well. Traditionally I ""cleanse the palate"" with a Warsteiner Pilsner and roll from there. Friday night, I tipped back a few Kiltlifters as well, all brought in well frosted pint glasses.

The food has been pretty fantastic across the board. Personally, you can't go wrong with Firecracker Wings (sweet and very spicy wings) and the Spinach Dip. Their seared ahi appetizer and Caesar salad are both fantastic, with the ahi always perfectly cooked. The Southern Fried Chicken Breast is likely the best meal, though my pal is a huge fan of the Cuban Dip.

The one potential drawback is the service isn't always fast. Honestly, if you are going to relax and enjoy time with your friends, it's great. Beer glasses don't stay empty too long, waters get refilled (we only sit on the patio), and the food usually comes out before you get too hungry. Just understand that the joint gets busy for happy hour and you will enjoy the experience. Give me a call if you ever want to share some FU beers!",1
"The place was just your typical stable, but my wife and I had a wonderful experience here. It was our first time riding, so the staff took great care to show us how to mount and maneuver the horses. We then followed a guide through an orchard for an hour's ride (just the right length of time for us as beginners). The horses were very tame, and were easy to ride. The best part of the experience, however, was our interaction with the staff. They couldn't have been more friendly and more helpful. We're excited to go back.",1
"Their food isn't bad, it's pretty hard to mess up gyros, rice, salad, and fries.  When it comes to this type of food it really comes down to preference.  For me, I didn't care for this place.  I like crispy fries, their fries are soggy.  I like Beef & Lamb gyros, theirs are Beef only.  I like a mixed green salad with light onion, they serve a shredded romaine salad with heavy onion.  Their prices are fair, portions large, and service friendly, it's just not for me.  They did have a lot of sandwiches and burgers that looked good, if that's your thing.",0
"""Fine dining"" is not just a setting.  it isn't just good food.  It is many things that add up to an attitude. I have had the opportunity to find it in different cities. I found it the other night at the Stockyards.

We were seated by a host who took us to our table and when we were properly seated gave us menus.  Our server came to the table and introduced herself and said she would return shortly.  It was nice to have a moment to chat before we had to think about ordering.  When she did return,  our glasses were filled-not something we should have  to wait for her to do when the service is right.  She knew the selections on the menu and all available options and could make sensible comments concerning them.  Our salads were served promptly by two additional people and were as fresh as I could ask for.  When my friend was finished with hers they asked if they could take her plate.  I was pleased when they didn't ask me if I was finished with my salad and could they take my plate.  If I'd been finished I could have told them.  We were able to continue our conversation uninterrupted as I finished my salad.  The salad plate was removed  when it was appropriate and we had a few minutes before the entrees were served.  All was in keeping with a relaxed dining.  At no time did I have to think about having drinks refilled, it just happened quietly.

After a few minutes our dinners were served by the two gentlemen and our server appeared to make sure they were to our satisfaction before we started.  There was no room for error there that couldn't be resolved before we started.  

My friend had ordered a small steak. My friend is  quite elderly and Kathy, our server, discretely asked her if she'd like it cut for her.  A potato also was served with her dish.  I asked my friend which of the condiments she would like it prepared with.  She look at me and said ""Prepared with?"" She didn't understand what I was getting at but Kathy did and was already reaching for the potato.   She opened the potato and smiled while my friend said a bit of everything.  One doesn't go to a restaurant like the stockyards to have to deal with opening a hot potato and preparing it.   When serving is done properly, these things don't have to be discussed.  Kudos to, Kathy!!!.  That is part of the fine dining experience.

I had a full rack of ribs which were so tender the meat fell of them.  The sauce had spice to it but not so strong the flavor of the meat was concealed.  I also can tell you that unless you are a big eater, half a rack would fill most people.  My friend said, ""Yummy!""  and I agreed.  I am used to getting a finger bowl for clean up after eating, but I can't complain about the two extra napkins and several ways of cleaning my fingers that accompanied my ribs.  

My friend let them know we were celebrating the 17th anniversary of my 39th birthday so they served me a free desert.  I can assure you the pecan pie is a delight!  Warm and laced with brandy, it was perfect way to finish our dinner.

The stockyards, I might mention, is not inexpensive, but what an enjoyable way to spend your money. They do offer two dinner specials you won't find at most other places.  They do have a luncheon menu that has lower prices.   Don't expect chrome and music that is a bit to loud as many of the new places offer.  Instead, just enjoy a time and place where they pamper you as you should be when you go to the Stockyards.

I don't consider the stockyards to be a place you where shorts and Nike's, but of course there are always a few.  I would say a nice shirt and slacks at least.",1
"Wow, this place is still here? I went there as a girl (15+ years ago) with the family on a regular basis. If it's still around, then it MUST be good!",1
"Can I tell you how much I despised Fate with all its pretentious, snooty bullshit? I should have known the second I realized that Bliss/reBar was in the same building that it was probably tainted from all the leftover evil.

And so it is. We showed up and the restaurant was practically empty. There is no hostess or even a hint of one. We stood there for many minutes on end before even being acknowledged by one of the many servers who were rushing around (perhaps serving to invisible people? The place was dead.). We were told there was a 15 minute wait, or we could eat on the patio. Um, it's 40 degrees...  AND THE PLACE WAS DEAD. I guess we'll wait. We go back outside because there is zero point zero extra room to stand. The server comes back out and says they have two large parties coming in an hour, but we can sit inside now if we can be done in 45 minutes. That's sure inviting, isn't it.

So we hustle on inside and make some hasty selections. $9 faux comfort food shit like gourmet mac and cheese just offends me, so I go with the veggie sandwich. That sounds innocuous enough, right? The food came out straightaway - too fast for a burger to be cooked medium well, like my companion ordered. Sure as shit, she cut into it, and it was bleeding and mooing all over the place. My ""veggie"" sandwich arrives and it looks like a Filet-o-Fish from hell, some huge block of something unidentifiable due to extreme deep-frying. I couldn't help it - I asked the server what the hell it was. 

Eggplant.

Ohhhhkay then. 

It was like trying to eat a deep fried brick between two pillows. Impossible. The pretzel bread, while yummy, is totally unyielding. Only Jenna Jameson can fit that thing into her mouth. My companion was suffering a similar fate with her bleeding burger. There was mayonnaise and shredded cabbage and boiling hot eggplant juice going everywhere and it was goddamn ridiculous. Neither of us got through even a half of our sandwiches. I wolfed down the side salad just to get something remotely healthy in there after the onslaught of grease, although I almost choked on the buckets of sugar syrup they call salad dressing.

So, while we are attempting to recover from this mess, the server goes MIA. You'd think if they were trying to hustle us out of there, we'd get a damn check. Nope. No. Nada. Had to chase someone down and ask for it. When it finally came, there wasn't even an itemized receipt, so even though the total seemed a little low I couldn't check it out. I was so over the whole experience at the point I didn't even care. I left a shitty tip and we escaped to the bar next door, where the cute bartenders gave us some free drinks and we sucked down innumerable $3 vodka specials for the next four hours. 

Just UGH in every way.",2
Best steak I have ever eaten is at Ruth's Chris steakhouse. Comes to your table sizzling hot. Sides are sold individually but are pretty good. The deserts and appetizers are awesome. Being an upscale place be prepared to take a hit in the wallet. If you really want to impress a date this would be a good place to do it.,1
"Went here last night when on our last night staying at the Hotel Valley Ho.  We were able to walk there from the hotel and it was so cute.  The wait staff were helpful and gracious.  Once we saw how large the pizzas were, they accomodated us and split the toppings on each side of the pizza so we got what we wanted.  I did think the olives were really salty, but that's that type of olive.  We had delicious wine and the bruschetta sampler.  Enjoy people!",1
"I love osso bucco, they have really good mexi-style osso bucco, so I love them.  I prefer to sit on the patio or in the bar.  But keep in mind, parking sucks if you go on a busy night.",1
"Went here for the first time a few weeks ago and it was some of the best BBQ I've had in Arizona. 

The service was great as well! The manager stopped by a few times as well as our waiter to make sure everything was good.

*****UPDATE***** 
Looks like they went out of business. Haven't been open for two weeks now.....",1
"Stephen G. hit the nail on the head - ""You buy a peaceful experience"". I was looking for a resort/spa but also wanted to take advantage of horseback riding as much as I could. This resort definitely exceeded my expectations - the staff is AMAZING (friendly, accommodating, etc), the food was delicious, the resort is beautiful and the rooms were also clean and well-maintained. Everyone I encountered went the extra mile with regard to service. I came back to NYC completely rejuvenated.",1
"Honestly the best part of this place is the unbelievable deal you can get on pet related products. Because they are one of the primary income sources for HALO Animal Rescue, people that have pets, tend to make donations. You can almost always find pet carriers for under $10. They have dog crates for training and you don't have to shell out a fortune for them. They have fish tanks that will allow you to let little Johnny get his feet wet in the world of pet care and the associated responsibilities without breaking the bank. If you are a person that shares your life with animals, you understand the rarity of these kinds of deals!

Yes they have clothes, furniture, tchatchkies, etc., but the real deals are on the pet products.

As a side note, HALO recently leased the MCCAC location at 5231 North 35th Avenue (It was the previous Maricopa County run cat adoption center). So if you are looking for a companion (cat or dog), check them out and support one of the fastest growing no-kill efforts in the US.

"Went for dinner on a Sat. night. I made reservations 1 week in advance and when my friend and I arrived to check in for our table, we were handed a pager and told we could go STAND in the bar area seeing as how there was no place to sit and have a cocktail. Not real sure why I bothered to make the reservation. About 40 min later we were taken to our table where there was NO ONE else seated at first for the Teppan cooking.Kind of a bummer. About another half and hour and more people were seated. It's only about 10 pm now and my friend is literally starving. The bar area is a joke. Maybe I just don't go to Scottsdale often enough but are these people serious?? There were maybe 4 guys under 25. The rest were in their mid to late 40's. The women were about the same age probably but wore outfits like they thought we wouldn't know how old they were if we just focused on the sparkly sequined shirt and puffy skirts. Or as my friend said, are these ladies re-living prom night or what?? Anyway, food OF COURSE is so over priced and where you think you might get 4 of an appetizer, you get 2. Nothing real special about this place. Once you look beyond the decor and focus on the ""scene"", service and food-Thanks, I will go to Hon Machi!!",2
"The Rusty Spur has the distinction of being the oldest cowboy bar in Arizona and a gen-u-ine registered historic landmark. It's even got a hitchin' post for yer horses out front. The Spur has been patronized by the likes of John Wayne and Clint Eastwood -- although never while I've been there. There's great live music four afternoons and six nights a week. Other good things include plenty of parking, no cover, and a fun venue to people-watch.",1
"The 3rd star is because they have EVERYTHING.  And you can't beat the prices.  And as far as crowded, budget conscious mega stores, this is definitely on the cleaner side, even with their current renovation project going on.

The dark side...  it IS a very crowded mega store, especially at the later hours.  And as crowded as it gets from 9pm-1am, there's usually only 2 checkers, which makes for LONG lines.  

If you can hit this place during a quieter time, earlier mornings or early evenings, then you can get what you need without breaking the bank.",0
"Restaurant 28 is a solid hole-in-the-wall that's pretty easy to miss, but it's definitely worth a stop.  On my visits I've gotten brisket and other barbecue, and my friends swear by the chicken and say it's some of their favorite chicken in the Valley.  The hush puppies are great- the greens are good too.

Another review said it well when they said this place doesn't underseason food.  Every time I've gone it hasn't been bland- it's got some great flavor and it's tasty stuff.

It's in a pretty dull area where there isn't much else to do, or I'd be out there more often.  It's a tiny place too but I've never been in and had it be hugely busy or busy to the point that waiting was crazy.

Definitely recommended, and I hope they're able to grow and thrive.",1
"Awesome resort.  I was able to stay there to celebrate a birthday in July, and fortunately it wasn't as hot as it usually is.  I am a wimp when it comes to heat, but the resort was wonderful, even with many things being closed.  The summer is off season for this spot.  We had a great time at the spa, and lying by the pool.  Be sure to have your food and drinks served there.  It feels so luxurious.",1
"This dog park gets one star.Why?Because the last time I went,some piece of shit broke into just about every car in the parking lot to steal whatever they could.So much broken glass from side windows everywhere.
It used to be okay before this incident,but a busy parking lot in borad daylight and some vulture lies in wait?
Yeah,I'm done here.",2
"I love this place. What can I say? 

Richard Cho not only has some of the best customer service skills I have ever seen (that guy has an amazing memory for names) but some of the most creative approaches to making Sushi in the valley. I love coming to Sushi Eye, I have never had a bad experience in all the years I have been going to the 2x New times Best of Phoenix award winner.

The use of Macadamia nuts is brilliant and an amazing addition to many of the creative rolls that are available. The Spicy scallop roll is a go to for sure. They have (and I know this sounds stupid) the BEST California rolls in Arizona. As pedestrian as that roll is, The California roll is transformed in to a very dessert style treat when ordered at Sushi Eye. Seriously, do it.

Go check it out, introduce yourself to Richard and be amazed when he remembers your name. You will be amazed by the food as well.",1
"Wish I could rate negative stars.... With so many bar choices this place is by far the worst.

Last Saturday a group of friends went out for a friend's birthday celebration in Scottsdale and decided if we split up that we would meet at the end of the night at Loco Patron. It was increasingly obvious that the staff was hostile and irritated that they could not close up early. We finished our last call drinks and started to head out. The friend who was celebrating his birthday waited behind at the bar until his friends left the bathroom. At this point two bouncers became extremely agitated at our friend and demanded that he put down his drink and leave. My friend started to explain his reason for not leaving (friends still in bathroom) but was quickly cut off. I watched from the patio as the two bouncers (both obviously larger in height and weight then my friend) quickly escalate from talking to both grabbing my friend under the arms and start to carry him out. As he was carried backwards he lost his balance and tumbled back with both bouncers on top of him. The bouncers slammed him down headfirst on the cement outside of the establishment, pinned him down with their elbows and hit him. At this point I had run behind the bouncers and was yelling at them to get off of him. I had already taken out my phone to call 911 and I quickly tried to take a picture to show that they were using excessive force. We demanded to see the manager at which point the bouncer said he was the manager and refused our request. He swiped my friend's phone down out of his hand and broke it on the ground. Several people had called 911 at this point and we waited outside for the police to arrive. The police arrived and took down the bouncers' information and stated that they would be recording this incident.

 I am absolutely adamant in saying that neither I nor my friends will ever frequent Loco Patron again. We were treated disrespectfully by untrained staff who were either too eager to close up to get home or get a power high by manhandling non threatening, non physical patrons of their establishment. Based on the behavior of the two bouncers I assume that this bar operates without any written guidelines on how bouncers should conduct themselves. What I witnessed was full on assault and an infringement on human rights and I plan on writing any regulatory agency I can think of. These people make a bad name for all of the bouncers out there that conduct themselves within the guidelines of the law.",2
"My husband and I had our weekly date night.  Mamma needed to get her drink! We decided to venture back to Phoenix since there are so many new places we wanted to try. Even though it was fairly empty, this place looks like it gets busy later at night.  I loved my Lectric Lemonade, great way to start the night.  I loved the decor, and the setting above a Starbucks.  Very hip.  The only thing I would suggest to the owners is to reprint their Happy Hour cards, it said HH goes from Mon- Sat.  Bartender said is only Mon-Fri.  I was not going to let that spoil my night and I really liked the place.  I will be back!",1
"I went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago with my bosses. It was packed on a Friday - we sat at the bar and our cook was fantastic! We got to sit and chat with him while he worked away at the orders. I had the chicken pesto pasty and it was wonderful! the bread used is similar to a pastry dough type...but not as sweet. The pasty was so filling, I could barely finish it.

My bosses have been there before and have always wanted to try the peanut butter and jelly pasty - so we all split it as dessert and it was so good. They put bananas in it and drizzle jelly over the whole pasty. It's definitely rich and gooey. 

I would totally go back here again and have told my friends about it too! Amazing place.",1
"I always find good used records at Zia.  I know I'll come out with something.  They're pricing is usually pretty high on records/artists/genres that are popular or trendy.  That's pretty standard for anyplace.  The Ghost of Eastside keeps their prices slightly lower with more obscure selection.

However, the flipside is that Zia will overlook gems in their used stock and price them pretty low.  Probably because they don't know much about certain band line-ups, labels or releases in general.  I've found quite a few gems for two or three bucks in the used section.  

Used records are where it's at.  There is no rationale in buying anything new because they'll press those things in such high numbers that they're not rare anymore.  I'll still buy some new things from bands and such.  Not a lot.

Anyhow, I inadvertantly went to this Zia on record store day.  I was eating with my kids at that Chinese place around the corner.

I found a bunch of shit (not all rare but stuff I wanted): The Shit Licker's EP ""Cracked Cop Skulls (total early swede crust/dis), Orchid s/t 7"" on Hand Held Heart, The Automatics ""Golden Hits"" and ""Makin Out"", Chubbies ""Im the King"" 7"" on Sympathy, The Tie That Binds ""Adding Machine"" 7"", Gravy Train ""Hello Doctor"" LP. 

All %15 off for record store day.

I'll always check out Zia.  I'll always check out anyplace that sells records but I have to say that I do like Zia.",1
"Don't let the ol' door-in-the wall/lack of window effect scare you! The Tally Ho does a fine, fine job of balancing that delicate mix of neighborhood watering hole/hipster hangout. The drinks are strong, the bar staff are friendly and everyone's in a good mood at this little dive bar. The music (stocked with a multitude of genre) is always on but not so loud that it interferes with conversation. There are a couple of pool tables, beer in a bottle and the drinks are served up just as ya ask for 'em. Can't go wrong with this place if you're looking for a quiet, entertaining hangout to throw a few back. Between the red vinyl and HUGE bar, I heart for Tally ho.",1

"Blue 32 wins my MVP award. I practically lived at this place during the Giants World Series run, and loved every moment of it! 

Despite the fact that I am still stuck in an orange and black-out World Series Championship daze (that will probably continue for at least another month or so), I must up the rating of this place to 5 stars because Blue 32 is now my favorite sports bar in all of Scottsdale. The service is top notch and the atmosphere is excellent for game watching.

Here are the main two reasons why I will keep coming back here: 1. Food - This is the best bar food ever! You must try their onion rings, they are crazy delicious. Also if you aren't in the mood for fried food they have tons of healthy options as well. 2. TVs - Sports fans, it doesn't get much better than this when it comes to TVs. Outstanding visibility from every angle of the restaurant. No sports bar in Scottsdale can compete with Blue 32's TVs.

Go here for a game and you won't be disappointed. I decked myself out in orange and black, screamed, jumped around with excitement and just all around enjoyed myself while hanging out in the bar area during the games. Overall, Blue 32 is a high quality sports bar and you've got to check this place out!

P.S. GO GIANTS! =)",1
"This is my parents' favorite place to eat when they come to Phoenix so we dropped by twice on our family vacation. The owner/proprietress convinced my mom (in mandarin) to let her pick the dishes for our first dinner so we didn't even know what would be coming. The cold smoked duck was sooo delish as was the special mountain leafy green with bean curd shreds (all minced fine and not on the regular menu). There was also a shredded pork dish with bamboo (excellent) and a pickled vegetable with fish soup. The soup wasn't really my thing because it was heavily seasoned with white pepper which I hate but the rest of my family said it was exceptional.

Our second visit was for lunch before heading off to the airport for the return trip. I could have eaten the entire scallion pancake myself as well as the cold spicy pork belly dish. Luckily, we ordered two orders of fried potstickers because those were delicious as well. We also had some tasty steamed pork buns but I was stuffed at that point.

If you really want to experience authentic shanghai food, let the staff order for you, you won't regret it.",1
"We got here around midnight last Friday... the place was dead. However, they were still serving food and we enjoyed some well made pub grub. Service was friendly, quality cocktails were served, and the atmosphere is derived from an old Uno's, which certainly works for a sports bar. It being located in a somewhat commercial area, I can see why it's empty so late on a Friday. From what my friends tell me - this is a great spot for happy hour, and it stays relatively busy thru 10pm.

*UPDATE - Great patio for day-drinking on the weekends!",1
"I've eaten at this Smashburger a few times and I'm always pleased with my food and the friendliness of the staff.  On my most recent visit, I called ahead to pick up my family's order and we were not disappointed, once again.  We ordered a variety of menu items (and in typical 'When Harry Met Sally...' style) - a grilled chicken spinach and goat cheese sandwich (subbing the goat cheese for American & changing the multigrain bun to egg), a build-your-own burger with an egg bun, spicy chipotle mayo, pickles and onions, an order of Smashfries, an order of french fries and an order of fried pickles.  Everything was made perfectly to order and plenty of extra sauces (ranch, etc;) were provided without having to ask.  
On weekends, this shop is jam packed and it's a wait to get a table, but worth it.  During the week, everything flows very smoothly and the vultures ""circling"" for booths is at a minimum.  
I highly recommend this Smashburger location whether dining in or taking taking your meal on the go.",1
"I hardly ever get past their carne adovada. It's simply amazing. Add a couple of extra homemade tortillas to it? Can't be beat! I have had their pecan crusted sea bass also, along with lamb chops (chipotle?) both very, very good. Great atmosphere, friendly, competent staff...a winning combination. Get there early! Long waits after 6:00pm!!",1
"""Fake"" (or rather condescending) service from the ""Service Manager""...and he didn't even acknowledge me when I asked the status of my car (uh, more like IGNORE). Ended every sentence with an impolite ""No ma'am"" or ""Yes, ma'am""... ya get the scenario. Basically, the guy was a real JERK.

They couldn't even figure out HOW to fix my car, even when I TOLD them what was wrong with it ( had been diagnosed at the Dealership). Two guys were sitting there staring at the computer (as if it was going to magically speak to them). At least they didn't charge me, but what a waste of time waiting for 90 minutes....",2
"Had lunch here today after hearing all the colossal raves about it. However, once I walked in, I realized that any semblance of having an authentic Chinese meal went out the window (no offense, my hungry white friends!). 

I decided to try it out anyway, was seated by a friendly waiter and ordered the hot & sour soup (they were able to sub in chicken instead of pork - bonus) and the waiter recommended the house chicken to me. I asked for it to be made really spicy, knowing full well it wasn't going to be (no one EVER listens to me when I demand the food be spicy - listen, dammit, I'm brown, people). Anyway, that's my issue.

The hot & sour soup arrived, and it was excellent. I was happy. Nothing mars a Chinese meal more than beginning it with a bowl of shiteous soup. Then came the house chicken (with string beans added for $1). Steamed rice costs another extra buck - I get annoyed when Chinese restaurants don't make it complimentary, but again, my issue. Anyway, the chicken was just ok. Nothing amazing and it still ended up feeling pretty heavy. So that dish I'm more willing to give it 2.5 stars. 

So why did I bump up the star wattage? I guess the service. 

The waiter:

* noticed I wasn't devouring my dish and offered to switch it for any other dish of my choice, no extra charge. Who does this nowadays - in a Chinese restaurant no less? Extra star.
* is from the SF Bay Area like myself, so he gave me the lowdown for good Asian food in Phoenix (for dimsum he recommended Golden Buddha first, Great Wall second, C-Fu third - then for Vietnamese he recommended some place on 19th Ave between Indian School & Camelback.) He agreed that Thai, Korean, and sushi in Phoenix is kind of a letdown compared to California, but almost all the Asian restaurants (he admitted, including China Chili) cater to their core customers, who by sheer demographics are pretty much not Asian. That said, he told me that China Chili is THE place people go to for Chinese food, including Chris Bianco (of Pizzeria Bianco), the mayor, folks from Channel 10 news, the owner of the Diamondbacks, etc. etc. So take that for what you will.
* When I asked if this China Chili was affiliated with...""oh, the one in Fremont? No. But people say that place is good and fancy and has an electric piano."" Bonus points for knowing that.

Anyway, he recommended I come back and get the Mongolian beef next time, which I'll definitely do, plus the hot & sour soup. I didn't mind the big open seating area - many Chinese restaurants in SF are like this, loud and raucous. 

All in all, China Chili is a case where service overcame the food (again, how often does that happen?) to come back and give it another shot. 

And there you have it.",0
"I love this place!  Authentic mexican food at inexpensive prices.  Friendly and attentive staff.  The cleanest Filiberto's I have seen.  I visit at least once a week during the lunch hour.  The Chile Rellenos are awesome, lightly battered, lots of spicy sauce... just simply delicious.  Taco Tuesdays (99 cent tacos) are a great bargain.  Complimentary salsa bar with multiple hot sauce type salsas, sliced cucumbers, and a fantastic spicy carrot/onion/jalapeno/chile salad... all free.  My only complaint is the salsa bar, soda fountains and cashier area, which are all located up front, can get very congested... I wish they could rearrange that somehow.  Oh, plus it would be nice to offer a chunky (pico de gallo) type salsa on the salsa bar, similar to Baja Fresh.  Check out the website for coupons - great deals!  You also will receive a bright orange (can't miss it) set of coupons with each purchase, to use on your next visit.  I'm a fan!",1
"I am glad I found this place but it is a bit far from where I am staying at in Phoenix. Their dumplings are really good, spicy cold potato salad was super good and refreshing but their green onion cake was a bit thick and starchy for me. I prefer Taiwan's thin and crispy green onion cake. Really clean inside and it is fresh, full of Asians!",1
I have literally never seen this place open and I live two blocks away.,2
"I went to Tuck last night because of the reviews on here, and I loved it.  It really is tucked away and all the better.  It feels even more special.  We had the panini bites, dates stuffed with chorizo, and the citrus brined fried chicken with white cheddar waffles.  Not your greasy comfort food here.  Everything was delicious and I can't wait to go back and try more.",1
"Good tattoo shop. Clean space, multiple artists to choose from and books of their work are available for you to look though and decide who's style most mirrors what you're looking for. I chose Jet to do a cover-up for me and he worked with me on the design and our ideas and communication flowed very well. He's a very personable guy, is friendly and keeps the conversation going while he's working on you, and he doesn't dick around (read: He starts to work and continues until the job is done). He's very professional and informative. Good customer service combines with talent at the craft.",1
"Be sure to see Taylor, her service is great, the food is awesome, had roast beef sandwich ...and a plank of bruschetta!  But without good service the experience lacks. Be sure to try it out.",1
Just the basics.  Nothing fancy here but you can get a pedicure with hot stone massage for $18!,1
Great place to go for a walk or bike ride.,1
"With all the hype before this place even opened I epxected a whole lot better. There are so may flavors lacking in the basic tacos. The tamales are so generic and dry.
The place is nice and clean and the staff is friendly and the little salsa bar is a nice addition which I had to give this place 2 stars. If you want geat tacos go to Gallo Blanco or to Americas.",2
"Great customer service, competitive rates, and I always get a call right back from Jeff! Nice to have an agent who actually cares about his customers. I would recommend giving him a call.",1
"Had a friend invite/take me to lunch here at The Mission.  The physical place was great!  I had the arepas which were good, not great.  My friend had the tacos, which immediately upon being served them he realized he'd have to order something else (small portion).

My portion for the arepas was plenty as the venezuelan sandwich itself is filling, but also came with a mix of regular and sweet potato fries, which were good.  Actually the ketchup/dipping sauce was awesome now that I think of it.

Price -- hmm, a bit overpriced for lunch in my opinion, but I suppose that is Scottsdale.  That's really what was the difference between a 3 and 4 star for me here.",0
"I'm gonna have to hide this review from my girlfriend who is from Wisconsin and a big Brewer fan. To be honest, this is my least favorite stadium to go to because of its location and just overall mediocre atmosphere. It has an outfield grass area, but it is kinda boring. Maryvale is a no frills ballpark, so if you are going to a Spring Training game to actually watch some baseball, this is the stadium for you. If you want to go for the game, the scene and overall experience, I'd recommend a stadium in Scottsdale. For what it's worth, a friend of mine says this is his favorite Spring Training stadium, but frankly I think he feels that way since it was the one stadium he actually played in while in college. I personally like to go to a game and then head over to some bars or restaurants, but at this stadium I check out the game and then get the hell outta there!",0
"Went there for my birthday .... 

Another quality insured restaurant, it is inside of Four Seasons, it cannot go wrong .... 
The restaurant is very classy with a nice and upscale environment .... and most of all with a very nice view to the phoenix area 
The service is definitely top-notch and food was excellence as well. Had the sea bass and the filet mignon .... both were yummy .... and customized birthday desert as well .... 

Will go back for a visit for sure ... 
Also if you are in Talavera, don't forget to grab a drink in the patio as well .... they have live music and watching the birds flying around the mountain (the resort is built into the mountain) was quite a view",1
"You don't expect to find a good restaurant in a strip mall, next to Costco, but Upper Crust is all of that. They have fantastic food, including fresh made mozzarella (made at the restaurant), really good chicken wings (ask for them crispy!), and, yes, great pizza. There's always a happy hour special going on and the bar and restaurant sides are totally separate, which is great for both families and the no-kid crowd. And, now, that it's cooling off, you can finally enjoy the patio!",1
"had lunch here today outside with the girlfriend and my mother. I have to say we were pretty blown away with the size of the hummus plate, 3 pieces of pita with a good 3/4 to full cup of hummus, for under 4 bucks.
 I had the chicken pita, tasted great  had onion, tomato, cucumber, and  tzataiki, freakin awsome! my girlfriend had the gyro pita and loved it. My mom had the lamb pita and says it was awsome... unfortunantly we were all being greedy and didn't want to share our pitas. I also ordered two falafel, best i've found, crunchy outside with a crazy mixture of being dense and light, you could taste all the flavor on the front of your tongue and the spice at the back of your tongue. We'll be heading  back pretty soon I hope. 

Also Lisa I think we spotted you there sitting outside. not sure it was you since you where sitting behind me and next to some folks with their dog.",1
"This place is essentially a copy of the old Father's Office (www.fathersoffice.com) in Brentwood, CA.  It took me a while to get over that fact and give it a decent try.  Among the things Delux has copied from FO is the famous ""Office Burger,"" which Delux calls the ""Delux Burger.""  They also bring out the fries in a shopping cart just like Father's Office.  What Delux fails to copy, however, is the quality of the food and the high-end nature of the original.  At FO, the wines changed weekly and are all incredibly rare selections.  The beers at FO also tend towards the more obscure.  Delux seems to concentrate almost exclusively on beers and does have a decent selection, but nothing you can't find elsewhere.  Wines are available, but as an afterthought, and definitely not of the quality served at FO.  For Phoenicians who never experienced the joys associated with the original Father's Office, you're missing out.  It's like being an Eric Clapton fan but not even knowing who Muddy Waters is.  But all the imitation aside, I have to say that Delux does a pretty good job with everything and they have taken the FO concept and adapted it to the PHX strip mall environment.  

Food wise, everything I have tried was ok.  They did change their sweet potato fries a year or two ago because the other ones weren't ""crispy"" enough.  The problem is that these new crispier ones have no flavor.  When they were testing out the new fries, the manager asked me and a friend to opine and we told him the truth: We said the new ones are flavorless.  I guess we were the only ones who thought so because they went ahead with that change.  That lost them 1 star from this review.  I would rather have the soggier more flavorful ones (who knows how they make these new ones so crispy anyways?).  

When I go here, it's almost always out of convenience and late at night.  Not many places of this caliber stay open until 2 am, so it's about all there is when you are in need of a late night meal in this part of town.  Their 2 star rating is based on: clearly knocking off one of my favorite places, Father's Office (minus 1 star) and for ignoring my feedback on the new crispy tasteless sweet potato fries (minus 1 star).  They also lose a star for retaining the FO prices but substituting Phoenix strip mall quality.",2
"Seriously the best 3am quesadilla I have ever had.  It was big and gooey, with just enough browning on the outside of the tortilla to make it a little bit crisp.  As an added bonus it was kind of cold outside, so it made a great hand warmer as well.  Why only 3 stars?  OK, you do have to sit on some questionable outside picnic tables and I don't want to think about how clean the kitchen may or may not be, but the entertainment value of watching tipsy people stumble around while waiting for their food can't be beat.",0
"We got an online coupon to try this place and went on a Sunday around 7pm for dinner. The decor is very cool-neat floral booths with plastic overlay, beer taps at the booths, amazing mural on the far right wall. 
We both enjoyed our margaritas, which for the size were fair on the $8 price tag. 
The food was tasty, but not original. We ordered the ceviche app (which we liked the best), the mushroom tacos and the house salad with shrimp. Although our waitress came back and informed us that they were out of shrimp so we opted to try it without as there aren't too many non-meat or fish options on the menu. The smashed plantains and pumpkin seeds were a nice touch in the salad, but it was lacking something special. 
I can see coming here for happy hour or for a fri/sat night drink. They had a DJ booth which was cool, but (and I may sound old for saying this) it was just too loud for a Sunday night dinner.",2
"After eating chocolate covered bacon for desert (yeah, that's really one of the options for desert), I say that I was completely stratified with Beckett's Table. From the moment I called to make a reservation I knew that this restaurant was going to have great staff and service. The staff greeted us at the entrance and give us options for seating. I was VERY pleased with the pricing on the menu especially the wine bottle prices! It's just a matter of time, and I will be back for an evening meal! Speaking from living in the Arcadia area, this is just the restaurant we need in the area--a nice community restaurant with pleasing food! If you are looking for a nice dining experience, this is the place for you!",1
"Your reviews are hilarious!!   (shoot--who was this referring to??)

I try to avoid WM.  I'm always warned about the possibility of TB or now, pig flu.  I think the hub just doesn't want to go shopping--not that I LIKE shopping.

I know someone who worked WM in WA and she says the conditions are just horrible for employees.  I've spoken to at least one cashier that is actually FRIENDLY and LOVES his job benefits and bonuses.  He's a minority I guess bc as you all said, YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING and CAN'T GET HELP without attitude, usually.  

I'm standing there staring at 2 mgrs, and they just ignore me for a few minutes?  I didn't want to interrupt the conversation, so I waited.  FINALLY, one asks if I need help???  NAAAAAH, I was just admiring your huge body and wondered how long it might take me to look that way.  FOOLS!  

On my last visit, a customer said ""excuse me"" to the 3 employees behind me in the aisle.  I glanced at her and she sighed, rolled her eyes and shook her head as they all ignored her.  I chuckled and acknowledged her frustration.  Then one employee pipes up with ""OH, I'm sorry ma'am, can we help you?""  She asks to find an item, the customer thanks them, they say ""You're welcome"", the customer leaves and they sarcastically continue to each other: ""THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR.  NO, THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE.  We're not here to find stuff for stupid people, we have better things to do.""    That's why, when I walk by an employee working, if they lay eyes on me, they immediately look away and pretend to be engrossed in their job, to avoid stopping to help.  WT?  What's wrong w/this management???  

I agree, you can find some deals and save some money, but the attitude is over the top.  There are a FEW employees that actually smile and appear friendly, at least when I see them, and I can point them out.  If not for the more often than not occurences as mentioned above, I stay OUT of WM as much as possible, which is a lot.  I've drastically reduced my trips there, but more importantly, I've cut out a huge chunk of purchasing from WM.",2
"What to choose, what to choose. Such difficult decisions! Seriously, this normally isn't a problem. Dispite the fact that I'm a libra, I'm very decisive. Friends usually look to me to make all sorts of decisions ::diabolical laugh:: Still, this place consistently stumps me.

Is it Tuesday? If yes, then I'm definately getting the Pork Belly Tacos.

Otherwise, I'll start with an order of Ceviche and Asado Salad.

To drink I'll have Agua Fresca de Sabor.

Yes, I'm going to have an entre too, I mean I've already broken my diet, might as well :D

I'll have the Huevos Rancheros or 3 Carne Asada Tacos or the Verduras de Temporada or the Chilaquiles Verdes or the Carne Asada Torta. OMG, so many great options! Seriously, this normally isn't a problem. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to try everything.

Next up, a euphoric food coma! Life is good.",1
"Pretty ok place, right in the thick of it, I saw 3 separate arrests while drinking beer on the patio.  They have a couple different 4 Peaks Brews.  Those facts alone made it a successful endeavor.  Did I mention it was 4pm on a Friday?",0
"The food was not particularly good on our last visit there and the service was rude and not helpful at all.  I even emailed them afterwards to give feedback, in hopes that they would redeem themselves by showing some good service that way.  No luck.  Didn't even get a response.

They will not be getting any more of my business.  Too bad because I'd actually had a decent mushroom burger there before and would have been a regular customer.  But the service last time was so bad that I won't go back.",2
"After eating here I was actually pissed off that I didn't know about it before. The portions of sashimi are amazingly large. That doesn't mean crap if the quality is not there, but fortunately for Sakana, it's there. They even have house specials (like salmon smoked on the premises). AWESOME! My only complaint is the lack of fresh wasabi (they have pickled or the powdered stuff). 

For the area, this should be 5 stars. I just can't compare it to Kiji in SF or Blue Ribbon in NYC, which are my 5 star benchmarks.",1
"Love the coffee not thrilled about my service. Of the 4-3 times I have been in the barista has never been behind the counter ready to serve me.  Every time that I have walked in they follow me off the patio where they have been smoking.  I know that you are entitled to a break but, sitting out chit chatting with your friends smoking is not what you get paid for.  Either I have bad timing coming in when they are on break or the kids there are huge slackers.",2
"This was the marriage of two of my favorite things alcohol and ice cream.  As Charlie Sheen would say ""Winning!!!!""

I had a groupon so Laura A. and I went to try out this amazing place.  The groupon got us each two scoops so we went with 4 different so we could sample the most possible.  I got the Apple Pie / Spiced Rum and Black Raspberry / Chambord Liqueur.  Both were awesome I actually enjoyed the Chambord the most but I was in ice cream heaven.  

Laura got the Mimosa with Champagne and the Margarita / Tequila.  I really enjoyed both of her's the margarita was a strawberry one which is my fav.  The Mimosa was very refreshing and I could imagine that being a great hangover remedy at about 11am on a Saturday =) just sayin.  

I have found a new place to cure my sweet cravings and can't wait to try more flavors as the website has many more I didn't see in store so I assume they are on rotation which is great.  

I hope that eventually I can find a pinapple upside down cake with rum flavor",1
"Didn't get to sit outside so a little disappointed.  We saw the ""big assed burgers"" and all decided to get one.  They were great but a bit messy.  Food and service were excellent.  Will try and get back for happy hour",1
"Best beer selection in Arizona but the good features end there.  It's the only reason I return and put up with the following.  Service is often horrible, even during the day when there are few patrons.  Often you have to go up to the bar to order even when there is a server in your section.  It makes no sense that a mug of beer should be empty for more than 10 minutes before it is noticed.

Food is subpar and wouldn't get such a pass from most people if this place didn't have the beer.  Prices are reasonable.  Website is often inaccurate re: what is actually on tap.",2
"The beach paradise of Ixtapa-Zihuatenejo awaited us....unfortunately, so did a connecting flight in ARIZONA of all places...

Long story short....1/3 of our luggage did not arrive at our final destination, various articles of our clothing are still missing as well as my cell phone charger...not to mention security forcing us to open sealed containers of my son's baby food and milk for litmus tests...

I looked on the bright side....at least we didn't get deported =)",2
"The pizza was crisp and delicious. The place is super casual and very comfortable. The staff is down-to-earth and friendly.

I loved the live music from Tom Mein on the patio. It felt great to be able to sit on the patio and enjoy a downtown Phoenix sunset in the spring.

Having beer and wine for sale was nice as well. I will be back to try more of the menu.",1
"Can someone please tell me why people go here???

Went to breakfast with Deb L, and she had a Living Social deal or one of those deal thingies. The place was packed, probably because it's a holiday week.

That doesn't excuse the EXTREMELY poor service. We sat down and waited. And waited. Servers walked by every few moments, nobody stopped to fill our water glasses or take our order. Finally, we both said something to a girl who walked by. She seems mystified that there was a job to do. With that many people working, getting a cup of coffee shouldn't take 15 minutes. Yes. 15 freaking minutes.

Food? Mediocre at best. I got the traditional eggs benedict with home fries. The only saving grace with the amount of ham on it. The English muffin didn't seem to be toasted. The eggs were *ok* but nothing great. The home fries? My 9-year old niece could do a better job. My burps right now aren't even good enough to brag about.

I'm sure if the service had been better, I wouldn't be so miserable right now. My food coma isn't satisfying. I will *never* go here again. Ever. I felt stupid leaving a tip, it was THAT bad. 

Total. Fail. Blech.",2
"I have to say I am not a big Valentine's fan. I don't like Hallmark holiday's. We ended up by chance going to MiMi's for Valentine's Day and they had a great menu and price for that menu for the evening. I am just impressed by their service, portion size and just the overall experience. I just love this place.",1
"Just dropped off a pre-paid label package.  A young lady was on duty.  Very cheerful.  This was a dead-easy transaction.  Drop off package, get receipt.  Other than having to wait in line (there was one person ahead of me), it was quick and easy.",1
They wouldn't honor pet co's online sale prices.  That's the first time I've heard about this.,2
"I visited the Keg in Tempe on a Satuday evening to reconnect with an old buddy from high school that I have not seen in years.  Overall, the meal was good.  Service was prompt, and they had my reservation.  The Keg has gone out of their way to have hostesses who could double as the models on the Howie Mandel Deal or No Deal gameshow, so initially I figured confusion would ensue.  It didn't.  : )

Beer was served cold and quickly when ordered, so no delays on the service.

Their appetizer choices were mostly seafood which doesn't help me out.  We got some kind of bowl of cheese and ""stuff"" and a plate of chips to dip with.  It was ok, but not exceptional.  I hope they turn up the appetizer department to take care of non-seafood eaters.

Anyways, the Wedge salad I got was very good.  Drenched in a bit more Blue Cheese than I would have expected even for a Wedge salad, so if you are adverse to too much dressing, you may want to get the dressing on the side.  

The steak I ordered was supposedly bacon wrapped, but I could not taste it if it was.  It was a good filet though, and they did cook to my ordered temp on the first order.  Always nice to get it right the first time!

The loaded potato and vegetable sides were good, served fresh and hot, again, no complaints.

Water refills were well timed and the service did not rush the meal or annoy.

This restaurant would only hit a 3 for me, but the manager called next evening following up on my experiences. (They had my phone number from when I made the reservation.)  I think that puts these guys in a good class since they are clearly working on the most important element of any restaurant, the customer service.  And oh yeah, the steak was good!",1
"One word can describe the food here:  perfection.

All the meals I've had here has been absolutely delicious served by the most charming waitstaff.

Someone recently told me their Chilean Sea Bass was the best he's ever had and I believe him . . . I can't wait to taste that dish!",1
Unfortunately this UPS location is less than friendly or helpful.  Try the location near Fry's in Fountain Hills.  They are very friendly and helpful!!,2

"Bottom line: the new owners bring you better beef than Al's in Chicago. Yes-they really do.

Italian food tastes better in Italy (usually). That meal on a dock in Sausalito is not the same even if you copy it exactly when you get home. Food is an experience that is altered by the location, mood, companions and results.  So, being at Al's in Scottsdale is not the same as being in Chicago...that's obvious, so get over the fact that you're stuck in North Scottsdale, and not in the Windy City. But the new owner's seem to have this place clicking. The sandwich is awesome, and they work the floor to check on your experience. They care. I read a bad review about a hambuger here...are ya nuts? Al's...ditch the burger...who cares? and customer...what the heck brought you here for a burger? Sheeesh. I digress...again.

I have always enjoyed a trip to Al's in Chicago. Portillo's, Johnny's, and don't even get me going on the Portillo's vs Al's debates, but even though Al's beef wasn't always the best quality, the combination of beef, grease, jardiniere, gravy (jus), spices, and peppers at Al's has always nailed it flavor-wise for my palate.
When I worked in Phoenix, a trip to Luke's on Indian School every few months would deliver an OK time, but it didn't really satisfy my craving for great Italian beef.
The first franchise for Al's at this location, brought those flavors I was craving, but messed up everything else about running a restaurant, and I still went back, and was sad to see them not make a go of it.

Unfortunately, that left a flavor void, and I kept waiting for new Management to get open...and just before they did, I went on a very serious training and diet regime. My latest race results and training schedule gave me a little room for coming off the regime a little, and I decided today was my perfect cheat day...I mean Al's day.

They really nailed it.
My fries were wonderful (I was eating them while they were bringing me hot sauce)....crisp, slightly browned, gooey in the middle, loaded with flavor, without being over-salted. 

The beef was absolutely great, better meat than original Al's in Chicago, as good as Portillo's in meat quality, but with all those insanely fantastic flavors I remember from my best sandwiches at Al's. Definitely one of my best sandwiches so far in 2012...and I highly suggest the ""Wet, with a side of gravy"" method.

Many may object, (oh, ye lazy masses) but, I think Al's tradition of fully-dipped sandwiches leaves you with a sodden mess, that takes the bread out of the sandwich equation. If you are indeed- lazy, well then the dipped style gives you more wet bread that has soaked up that insanely good flavor combination. So if you are lazy, and also-messy, get it dipped. But there is a better way- it just takes a little work and technique...so simple it's easily mastered by a hungry 7 year-old, but they can also fix a frozen iPhone, so....

The perfect compromise is to order the sandwich Wet, with a big side of gravy (no charge for that- thank god). You can pour large amounts of the jus into the end as you go (obviously held upright), pinching the sandwich down below your planned bite, so the jus doesn't just run through, but soaks the meat and that portion of the bread from the inside out. Lot's of the jus is what Al's beef needs to soak the meat and release that delicious flavor combination, absolutely soaking the bread too, but maintaining the sandwich integrity, while adding in a tiny little bread crunch on the outside. 

(As a caution: you can order the beef ""Dry"". My advice if that would be your choice: don't go here. This is not a sandwich that is designed to be eaten dry- the beef will be flavorless and without charm. A Roast Beef from a good deli will be awesome if that is what you are in the mood for)

""Wet, gravy on the side, sweet and hot peppers, cup of hot sauce."". Spice the gravy up with hot sauce to your taste, pinch that sandwich, and pour as you go.

Freaking awesome sandwich, that blows away the local alternatives. And I'm perfectly happy with a spotless, new interior in North Scottsdale. I don't need Chicago memorabilia or grungy atmosphere to enhance my sandwich experience when the beef is this good. Bring a few good friends, order up a few beef, try a combo with sausages, share and compare, and start your own great dining tradition. Very cool to think that I won't be jamming a daily Italian beef into every Chicago trip just because I couldn't get them anywhere else. 

Gotta step up the training another notch so this can be a weekly lunch choice, because I am stuffed right now, and I still want more of that flavor!!",1
"This is a top sushi joint?  Really?  I had kinda forgotten what less than medicocre sushi tastes like.  Most conveyor belt places serve more flavorful sushi.

First of all, what's with the mayo on everything?  Rule of thumb: if it has mayonnaise or tomatoes, or if it's cooked and lacks an exotic name like ankimo, it's probably not real sushi.  My tekkamaki had a funny color and sour taste to it and for goodness sake, why can't they call it tekkamaki?.  The scallop sushi was not very sweet.  The softshell crab roll was greasy and without texture, not to mention the white mayo-laden crab salad that accompanied it...shudder!  This place averages 4+ stars on Yelp.  You're kidding, right?  You people must not get our that much.  Whats the criteria for a 3?  It stays in your stomach?",2
"Not bad, but not my first choice for the area. The staff are friendly and the food is good, but it just feels too much like a man's club. 
That being said, it is a great place for guys to go for dinner who are really looking for dinner. I think I need more... of something.",0
Just moved to AZ and this is my local Petco. Everyone's really helpful and friendly. We just took our dogs here to get groomed and they came back smelling fresh and looking clean.,1
"So excited to have another Royal back in my life! I worked in downtown Phoenix before, and I was sad to see Royal leave back in the day. I never made it to Royal at the Market - sadly I reverted back to corporate America coffee after Royal left downtown. 

Luckily, Biltmore Fashion Park has been really pushing the opening of this coffee bar at the Red Door spa. After waiting for it to open, I finally went down there today. Sure, they are just opening, so there's some kinks. Today they didn't have a ton of syrup selections, including my favorite almond rocca. However, they're getting them all in very soon! AND they offer almond milk - how awesome! They've got three benches inside too. Although it's pretty small, and awkwardly has an elevator leading up to the Red Door spa, I think it's a pretty cool space. Can't wait till they get up and running and bring some decent coffee to the Biltmore. Great hours too - open early! 

***If you've never had Royal before, please go try it.*** I think their lattes have a very unique flavor, something I haven't found in any other coffee joint. I can't believe I didn't drive to the Market location before this - but now I have something closer!

Some tips - park by the Capital Grill and the big red door (duh). Luckily they have a Royal at the Biltmore sign on the window, or else I might have missed it. It'd be awesome to nab a 20 minute spot outside Mojo Yogurt too. They have a token validation machine, so don't be afraid to park in the token lot!",1
"This place has really bad service and the food is barely decent, I would advise not to dine here. There are much better Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix.",2
I came here hoping to catch brunch but I guess it ends at 11:30am or 12pm. Luckily the lunch menu looked just as tasty. We ordered the Luau pulled pork sandwich (the jalapeno cole slaw gives it a nice kick) and the Monte Cristo (french toast instead of regular bread slices = delicious). Service was friendly and attentive. The dining area is decorated like a household- very comfortable and clean.,1
"I've decided to up the rating of this place to 3 stars because I went back for a second try. (it was close to work)  This time the burger actually had juices left.  They still wont cook it less then well done which puts me off but at least it had flavor this time.

I still dont recommend this place when you can spend a bit more and get a real burger at FEZ, Zinburger or Delux.",0

"This place is great. The food is Northern Chinese similar to Chinese Muslim food. They have a great variety for reasonable prices. Also, everything is freshly prepared and you can even see them make the dumplings and pork pie behind a glass window.
We got the stir fry spinach (bok choy) with garlic, sesame bread, pork and napa cabbage dumplings, pork pie and green onion pancakes. I know its a lot of food but we wanted to try a good variety and it cost about $27. Not to shabby! the spinach and garlic was really fresh and flavorful. The bread was decent, almost like a dense curried bread. The pork dumplings were similar to soup dumplings, one of my most favorite dumplings ever. The pork pie was almost like a pork patty covered in dumpling dough and pan-fried. It was crunchy, moist, juicy and delicious all at the same time. We were getting full so we ended up only eating half of the green onion pancakes which were well prepared. We will definitely be making another trip back here soon.

Side note: They sell bags of frozen/take-home dumplings. About $10 for a bag of 40.",1
"I feel like such a noob. We consider ourselves foodies to a certain degree, but before joining Yelp we had never heard of this magical mysterious place called Fez. So after seeing the sheer volume of good reviews on the place, it was pretty much destiny that a trip to Fez was in order. 

Upon first arriving there the first thing that'll catch your eye is how trendy it is. The place is drenched with a hipster vibe that's hard to shake. You'll also quickly notice a very skewed gay:straight ratio. I would usually never bring this up, but it was quite obvious the night we went that we were possibly one of the only straight couples there. This extends to the waiters too... don't get me wrong, I have no problem with it... in fact it made for a more fun and interesting dining experience; just be forewarned if you aren't comfortable with things like being offered a drink called ""The G-Spot"" by a feminine male waiter, this may not be the type of place for you. 

So now... onto the food. The food was superb... starting off with those heavenly Cinnamon-dusted Sweet Potato Fries. Damn they're good... basically they're some of the best fries I've ever had, period. I bow down the God of Cinnamon and Sweet Potatoes... because the combination is heavenly. For our main dish we got a Fez Kisra followed by the Apricot glazed Salmon. Both were quite yummy. The Kisra is basically a healthier version of a pizza with some more adventurous types of toppings... the one we got had pears on it. It was good, but would be hard to eat one alone because the flavor is quite distinct and a little rich... so it's perfect to split. The salmon was well cooked and flavorful, no complaints there. 

Overall we had a great meal at Fez, we'll more than likely be back... if anything to try 'Fez Foodies' which we've heard so much about. What a cool place!",1
"It was a Sunday morning & Mimi's was PACKED! We walked in, gave the hostess our name & told the wait wouldn't be too long considering it was just the two of us. The décor was French quarter New Orleans-themed, with Parisian style knick knacks & art work abound. A bit on the kitchy side, but quite nifty IMO! What I found to be not only impressive but wise was that they had free coffee, mini muffins & sample size nut loafs for the waiting patrons, which mostly consisted of seniors & families. 

Following the hostess to our table, I couldn't help but notice, the humongous portion size of ALL of their dishes. 

The menu had so many mouth watering choices, but considering I was feeling ill, I ordered a bowl of granola & a (YU-MMY) buttermilk spice muffin. Boring I know, but lemme make it up to you by talking about moms dish, the 3 egg avocado & crab omelet which was made w/ jack cheese, tomatoes, scallions, bacon & asiago cream sauce, accompanied by red potatoes, choice of one of their mega-sized (hot & fresh) muffins & fresh squeezed O.J. 

The service was on the slow side, perhaps understaffed or just overwhelmed, but our waiter made it up to us by giving me choice of beverage & extra muffins, no charge. 

For those of you who want healthier options, don't you fret, they offer a Fresh & Fit menu as well. 

All in all, I really enjoyed my dining experience @ this Mimi's location & will definitely return if I'm ever back in Phoenix.",1
"So Wednesday evening I needed milk and cat food. On my way to the store I realized my stomach was growling. Never a good idea to shop on an empty stomach. A while back in The Savvy Shopper rag in the China Grill ad was a little banner about Wok n Stix being a new location. And because of an event that fell apart this week I had a bug to eat something Asian. So I found it and stopped in.

Chinese fast food. They also have hamburgers and a few other things. I stuck with something I figured I would like, orange chicken ($7.95). It came reasonably quick, was too hot to eat right away. Most of my Chinese fast food consists of Panda Express and Ming Gee. This was much better, in addition to the onions and bell peppers listed mine had mushrooms, celery, sprouts and some other stuff. Service was on styrofoam with plastic utensils. Even though I was eating in the rice came in a take out box which I thought was sorta weird. I still hate eating out alone but at least I wasn't the only person in the place. Each side of the place had a long upholstered bench with tables and chairs that could be slid along to make up different seating and two tables in the middle.

There was nobody being served at the front counter when I was finished so I stopped,picked up a menu and talked to the woman there and found out she is an owner. They have had the place for 6 months and are the same family that owns China Grill not far away.",1
"Kind of surprised myself, but I have to give them a five.  Let's begin with the drink was excellent.  I had some kind of pom martini that was one of the best I've had in a while.  I ordered the sirloin steak cobb salad.  My salad arrived two minutes after the people I was eating with, and it was taken off the bill....they also brought us a free dessert and apologized...really?  That's good service.  They may have even gone overboard, but I didn't complain.  The food itself was excellent.  I loved my salad, and it was a nice size portion.  All in all, a great experience.",1
"This place is pretty darn good, if your into bbq. My husband ordered a burger with bacon, brisket and cheese, this was very tasty! I ordered the bbq chicken salad, room for improvement here. It was plenty big, but lacked in significant flavor. Mostly lettuce, a small amount of corn, almost nothing else to speak of.  The reason I gave it four stars is because of the burger and fries that were pretty awesome.  I guess it's just not a place for salads.  The customer service was great as well. They were training a new girl, but she had a wonderful attitude.",1
I`ve had work done by this shop a few times thruoghout the past few years. My latest experience was when my sons car broke its timing belt and needed substantial repairs. Bob informed us that he could move the car out of the way in his lot to be safely stored until we decided whether we wanted to fix it or not. This is just one of the reasons why I`ll always bring my business to him.,1
best. grilled. cheese. and. tomato. soup. ever.,1
Amazing food and I prefer the atmosphere at this location.,1
"I've always had good service here, but we usually do the curbside pick up - my advice is to just order a few toppings.  The crust cannot handle more than one or two - and if you get the pesto, avoid getting pepperoni plus other meat, it's so greasy!  (Good, but greasy).  

Love the greek salad as well as their desserts.",1
"Ever since I was diagnosed with a Gluten intolerance, Chipotle's yummy burrito bowl has been my constant companion. The barbacoa is seasoned well and works even better with a kick of the Chipote Tabassco sauce!",1
"This airport is the most confusing airport I've ever been to.  Obviously it was meant to be small and was originally probably very efficient, but since they have added terminals it makes no sense and you will see the sign you need as you are passing it, instead of having a sign a mile or so ahead telling you were to go.",0
"Tried Shorty's today, sadly it will be my one and only visit. To begin service was mediocre at best, portions are small(I thought my steakburger was a slider), and there was also the black facial hair that was in between the cheese and burger. That's when customer service went down the drain, all we got was a ""that's weird"" and an I'm sorry. If your running a joint and a customer finds a big hair in their food you do whatever you can to save that customer and make them want to come back. Something, not just sorry for your luck. I will stick with RocketBurger, just up the street, cheaper, bigger portions, tasty and most important, they got great service. If I had to sum it up for ya in a few words I'd say""DON'T DO IT""!!!!",2
"With a name like ""The Lodge"", I thought I was going to an old dirty restaurant with some of the neighborhood locals. We went here after a soccer game two weeks ago, and I have to say, I thought I was going to be disappointed. I expected greasy food, and grimy scenery. This was not the case, although the scenery was mildly disturbing as most of the decor included some dearly departed wildlife. I had a great sandwich I believe called the healthy choice, that was supposedly was healthy? It came on this great thick toasted buttery whole grain bread, egg whites, hollindase sauce, tomato and avocado. It was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. I don't think it was a calorie saver by any means but I am sure it was just the idea it was made with healthier ingredients. For a lodge, this was a terrific restaurant, and yes this is a compliment by far, joking aside, as you remember my thoughts of what a lodge was all about. This is nothing like the local VFW. The only other scary part was this jerk at the bar decided to take his shirt off, and throw it across the room. And ladies, no, this was definitely not a pretty sight nor was it funny. They need to enforce the shirt and shoes required law here otherwise it will earn a lodgey reputation from me. Luckily, as this ghastly sight appeared, we quickly disappeared on our way home.",1
Great brewery and open atmosphere!  Had the Buffalo Chickens sandwich.  It was great.  Washed it down with a Sunspot Golden Ale which was awesome.  Will return to sample the other beers.  Making a reservation online worked like a champ.,1
"Well, what a pleasant surprise!  I stopped by with my children to check it out - planning to eat elsewhere because my daughter eats gluten-free, etc., etc.  Then I met Payton Curry and realized what he and the Brat Haüs are all about.  Great food and a desire to serve!  Payton delivered on fantastic organic salads that were gluten, egg, dairy, and soy-free and tasted great!  And he threw in a few organic surprises.  Now I have a place to eat phenomenal Moroccan lamb hot dogs while my daughter can enjoy healthy food.  On our second trip, Payton remembered us and came out to let us know he had made some falafel (in the shape of a sausage, of course) and offered my daughter one in a salad or a lettuce wrap.  She chose the wrap (more fun) and loved it.  I have NEVER had personalized service like this!  Cool place, cool patio, great beer selection, great-tasting unique food selections, and, best of all, great people!  Congrats Dave and Payton!",1
"Stark white, steel bar, dark wood beams....modern and chic. The chopped salad is wonderful...i've never seen anything like it.  It was rows of different ingredients and tossed together in front of me.  Apparently, it has been imitated by a lot of other places, which I saw later in my trip.  This version was the best though...smoked salmon, sunflower seeds, large couscous, sweet corn, arugula, tomato, and the creamy basil dressing is better than everyone else's...i'm guessing the ingredients may vary depending on what is fresh and available.  The bar staff was friendly and made me feel comfortable dining by myself.  The drinks are phenomenal...I got the Citi-zen, which came with rock candy that I can stir until my desired sweetness is infused in my pear ginger martini.  I had a great weekend visiting wonderful places while in Arizona, and this is one of them!",1
"OK. So I think that this may be the first business that gets one star from me.  I just flew home from Israel on this airlines.  Boy, they are pretty sad.  I usually don't like to be too harsh on anyone, but this airlines deserves it.  

Please, don't think of this review as complaining, but rather a warning to others out there to never fly US airways (Nobody likes a complainer right? Haha.).  Well, not never, but if you have no other choice.  I would venture to guess that this airlines is pretty cheap because of the full flight loads that i encountered.  You could say that is good for them but the service on the planes was not up to par.  I guess I have been spoiled with the likes of Hawaiian Airlines, Nippon airlines, shoot, you can even throw Delta in there.  The flight attendants are rude. This is from both personal experience and from observation of my own.  

You know what, I could go on and on, but I really don't like to cry about stuff.  Would I fly US Airways again? No way.  If it was one of the last airlines on Earth?  Maybe.  I just hope that their service of customers get better.

  Then again, maybe they didnt treat me well for the fact that I hadn't shaved and looked Talibanish.  Oops.",2
"I'm completely impressed by The Mission and I can't wait to go back and try more of their amazing food.  

My husband and I chose The Mission for our 8th Anniversary dinner and had a wonderful time - the staff is extraordinarily knowledgeable and very warm & welcoming.  Yelp steered us in the right direction as per usual, so we split the cheese plate with manchego to start, the pork shoulder tacos for dinner and split a pumpkin bread pudding for dessert.  Everything was expertly prepared and delicious.  The bread pudding was EASILY the best I've ever had.  We usually don't order desserts and I'm glad we did, because I can't stop thinking about how amazing this was.  

My husband had an Avocado Margarita and an Estrella beer (Awesome that they have this available - and it was even served in an Estrella glass - impressive).  Since I'm pregnant, I asked if the bartender could make me a virgin version of their ""Sophia Loren"" with fresh strawberries & mint - score!  It was delicious and I'll certainly be back to try it with the proper amount of booze :)
  
Lastly, how amazing is that Himalayan Salt Brick wall????  I NEED this in my house!",1
"I got on the internet and looked at the menu and called in the order. I informed Brother's that I had a $3 coupon also and would pick up the perpperoni pizza and sampler and they said it would be 20 minutes.  At the register I was charged $12.95 for the $8.95 sampler.  I told the cashier that the internet menu had it listed for $8.95.  She just smiled and said ""Oh, we get that a lot but we don't have a menu.""  I said, ""but it's on the internet with your address/web page""  and she said, ""yeh, I know we get that a lot but here's our menu""  and she handed me their copy-machine menu which did not even have the sampler listed.  I politely told her that they should take the menu off the internet if it's not right.  The sampler was 4 pieces each of wings, mushrooms, cheese sticks, zuchinni.  The sampler was just like frozen generic small pieces ""out-of-the-freezer-bag"" deep fried. 
 
 I live near and our family had hoped to make this our weekly outing for pizza; however, I'll go elsewhere for better food and prices.  I also don't like false advertising.  

A customer's frustration should be a business owner's learning opportunity to make their business better.  They can learn a lot from their customers.",2
I came here today for a manicure and pedicure... I have been here quite a few times; it is a place my girlfriends like to come to so when I want to hang with my girlfriends and get a mani/pedi this is where we meet.  Although today I was solo:(.  The ladies here do a really good job; my manicures always last a really long time and they are really nice and accommodating.  Today I had one girl doing my pedicure and another doing my manicure... now that is what I call service!  I was out of there in a hour.  They do not have a tip line on credit or debit so bring cash for the tip.  Today I did not have cash ( i forgot)  they were so nice they said next time I come I can tip then if I want.  I came back anyway to tip them because it was so fast and my nails look great.  Oh another thing I forgot to mention is they use the hot rocks for the massage part for both the manicure and the pedicure and the callous remover is part of the cost of the pedicure.  Total for both services including getting french manicure on toes and fingers was $42.00.,1
"I've traveled to Phoenix several times for business trips and stayed at the Ritz. True Foods was my go to spot in Phoenix because it was right across the street from the hotel. I love this restaurant for the casual vibe and healthy food. My favorite dishes are the Edamame Dumplings and the Miso Glazed Black Cod. It was often hard to get out of work for lunch, so coming to True Foods at the end of the day was always a treat. 

I only wish they had one in San Francisco!",1
"I'm still a big fan of the light rail! Sure, I can't use it every day, but it's about the only thing that will get me to head to downtown for a night out.  

It's perfect for pub crawls, you can gather a huge group, keep everyone more or less together, and make frequent stops.  The extended hours mean more time for drinking!

The trains have stayed clean, they run when they are supposed to, and I've never had a problem.  The people watching is awesome as well.  Each stop is a mystery grab bag of the teeming masses of people here in town. 

I just wish it had a wider range, I'd use it every day if I could.",1
"Bleh. 

I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this spot, since I frequent the other spots on the same corner.  I had some pretty high hopes that this might end up rivaling Postino's or Bomberos... or well... something other than a drive-thru.

I ordered the daily flatbread pizza.  It was a Chicken Teriyaki with prosciutto, pineapple and red jalapenos.  The ingredients didn't seem to be of the best quality.  The chicken was a little gristly (sliced breast meat would have been nice), and the cheese was unspeakable.  It was straight-from-a-bag mozzarella... which was congealed into a huge mass of grease.  The pizza was so wet with sauce and grease and heavy from too many toppings, that I couldn't even identify the crust... it was disintegrating before my eyes.  The prosciutto was all in one large clump, instead of being sprinkled throughout.  So disappointing.  My friend's caprese salad was mainly a plate of tomatoes with a garnish of cheese and a sprig of basil.  I love a good caprese - and especially enjoy when there is a fairly equal amount of all ingredients.  Helps balance out each bite, you know?  No such luck with this one! 

Our service was fine.  Helpful enough in the beginning, but I think once she sensed we weren't thrilled with our food, she just tried to get away with a minimal amount of interaction.  The waitress never asked me how my meal was... even though I was clearly picking at it, and only ate half of it.  She offered to clear it away - not box it - so, she must have realized I didn't enjoy it.

I will definitely wait a while for a return visit.  Since it is close and has a great layout/atmosphere, I am hoping that they work out these rather large kinks and become the kind of place that I would like to revisit.",2
"Super cool space, friendly host (owner?) making all feel welcome and at home. Went with a large group on a Saturday night prime dinner hour and it was a no hassle wait, perhaps due to the company, it was painless. The Four Peaks beer choices, games of skill and comfy waiting area eased it as well. Service was attentive as sometimes large parties are tough to handle, but I observed no glitch here. 

I do plan to return when excessive day drinking has not blurred my perspective, but I remember having some pretty solid food. I sampled the Fontina cheese appetizer, perhaps my expectations were askew but I was surprised to see cheese sticks. I suppose I envisioned a wedge of cheese, either way it tasted fine and the pair of dipping sauces were unique. Sharing the same dish a savory romesco balanced with a sweeter pear sauce, I enjoyed them both with the cheese. Skirt steak is spiced nicely with garlic, chile and cumin ,charred and sliced, smothered with tasty mushrooms comforted by a hearty scoop of Yukon mashers. Not my optimum presentation as I like to cut it myself. I think the beef, which tasted great, went beyond the medium rare request which seemed to just be ignored. Not enough resting time from grilling to cutting and plating I would guess, however the meat was still juicy .I also had the chance to sample the maple glazed pork with pear crisps. Yum. Well cooked ,juicy and chock full of smoky sweet goodness. The side of Gorgonzola grits was a bit loose, but the flavor was very nice. Portions were very generous. 

Looking forward to checking this spot out again without the world of beer fest goggles head start.",1
"The best sweet and sour soup ever!  Food is delicious and favorable.  Delivery is pretty good, nice people.",1
"I've been here three times and have had terrific food each time.  The meat is incredible and their sauces are amazing.  Portion sizes are generous and the mac & cheese is delicious!  This is what BBQ is all about, definitely one of the best in Phoenix and we're lucky to have it here in the NW valley!",1
