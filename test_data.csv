3,This place is old but the food is good. The compliments arent that great...such as the basil and bean sprouts they give out. Their soy milk is made fresh and does not come from a Yeo's can.,neutral,en
4,"This is one of my favorite theaters.  

It's a little known fact that the first showing of the day for any film is only $5.  This keeps my wife and I coming back.  One of our favorite things is to see a movie at 9am and hit a great spot for brunch afterwards.  And yes, they don't mind when you show up in pajamas with Starbucks.

A great time!",positive,en
5,"Where else can you get fresh lemon grass, fresh pork uterus, and avocado ice cream?  Asian markets are the bomb, but Lee Lee's is the BOMB DIGGETY since they have EVERYTHING.  Jamaican, Cuban, Vietnamese, Korean, Indian, Lebanese---you name it.

If you love to cook (and I do, I really do!) you can seriously spend hours here.  

ONE CAVEAT:  The seafood is fresher and better at 99 Ranch on 44th St. in Phoenix.

Last week, they were giving a 10% discount off of your grocery bill and a free bottle of fish sauce or soy sauce.  If you spent over a certain amount, you got a big bag of rice.

Go!  Now!

And have lunch in the Vietnamese restaurant attached.",positive,en
5,"In short - Jen rocks!

Finding someone I trust to watch my crazy crew is always a bit nerve-wracking.  I came across Jen's Pet Sitting while searching for options, since I'm relatively new to the area.  

I decided to book a consultation with Jen to have her meet the furry family and learn more about her and her services.  Jen is extremely professional and came ready to take notes and also spent a lot of time getting to know my critters.  It was clear from her interactions with my cats and dogs that she loves animals and really understands them.  

After having a great experience with Jen during the consult I booked her to do visits over a long weekend.  The hubs and I took our dogs along for the trip and Jen looked after our cats while we were away. She gave us regular daily updates about our cats while we were gone.  Sometimes she sent pictures with her updates which was an added bonus!  Jen spent time playing with our cats during each visit which was fabulous.

I always know I've found a wonderful petsitter when I come home and my animals are a little disappointed to see me!  We will definitely continue to use Jen in the future.",positive,en
2,"We tried this out last night. We won't be back. 

There is no indication when you walk in that it's a seat-yourself restaurant. We stood like idiots at the hostess area until somone asked us if we needed something. 

We sat ourselves, and then sat and sat and sat because there was no server assigned to us. Perhaps that is a reason to seat patrons, so a server knows they've arrived?

Finally, the hostess asked us if anyone had helped us, and she was very polite and took our order. 

Our drinks came out fairly quickly, but then we waited and waited for our food. This would have been understandable if the placed had been packed, but it wasn't. It was maybe 75% full (7:30 on Saturday) and there seemed to be plenty of servers. There was one large party on the patio.

I ordered the vegetarian salad (can't remember what it was called) that advertised avocado, jicama, beans, and other yummy things. When it arrived, there was a tiny little mushy sliver of avocado perched on top, and no more to be found. It was as if someone scraped up the dregs of an avocado from the rind of an empty one and flung it on my salad. It would have been more forgiveable if they had just forgotten it altogether. Also, the white beans were undercooked. 

The pizzas were good. I ordered the local organic vegetable one without cheese, and it came loaded with summer squash, roasted carrots, olives (local? Hmm...), leeks, roasted onions, and the crust was thin and crispy. My husband also enjoyed his pizza. 

I should actually grant an additional half star to the hostess/waitress, who comped my salad when I complained about it. I was willing to pay for it, but she offered to take it off the bill. 

The final nail in the coffin was perhaps not the fault of the restaurant, but the large party out on the patio had 3-4 elementary-age kids literally running laps through the restaurant for the first 15-20 minutes we were there. If ignorant parents are content to let their hellions ruin other diners' experiences, then I'm afraid it's left to the restaruant to politely and discreetely ask the parents to please reign them in. No such luck. 

Anyway, this place has some things to work on. Fortunately for us, there are too many other great businesses nearby for us to give it a second chance.",negative,en

5,"Oh, where to begin..

I stopped by Pappadeaux last week to grab a bite when on a Wed, they told me it was a 45min wait for two.. wow.  The place was packed.   The hostess recommended we make a reservation for the weekend, so we made one for Friday at 7PM.

The smells coming from the place when you first pull in automatically keep you wondering what delicious things are waiting inside.  

I'm so glad we did. 

We showed up and they gave us a card with a number and once our number showed up on the screen, it was seating time.  I think we waited maybe ten minutes.

After gazing over the menu for a quick minute, we decided to try the fried alligator with creole sauce.  Being one to enjoy new things, I was pretty excited.  The waiter took our drink orders and and put in the appetizer.  The place at this point was insanely packed, but it was nice to see a place like this.  Made ya feel that something good was to come.  Heck, a place cant' suck if it's this packed, right?   So we order our food, I decided on the stuffed shrimp and the rest of my friends all ordered different things.  It would be a share-a-meal night.. 

About 10min into drinks and conversation, they bring out the fried alligator..  Ok, if you've never eaten anything weird before.  Please please.. you've got to try this.  It sorta reminded me of a cross between soft pork or chicken.  The taste literally melted in my mouth.  To top it off, the creole sauce that went with it, only complimented it.  I could easily have eaten the entire plate alone.  Sadly, I had to share..

After quickly destroying the fried alligator, we got our entrees.  I took one bite and had to pause a moment.. the taste of the stuff shrimp with the crab, Alfredo, spices inside just floored me.  There were only six pieces, but after sharing a piece or two and eating the amazing green beans, this was plenty of food. 

I can't wait for my next trip here.. fantastic food.",positive,en
4,"Fun Saturday night music venue with good food & beer for only a few $. The music is fun and tunes everyone knows. The 1$ carne asada tacos are straightforward; meat, cilantro, onion, grilled jalepe√±o - delicious! Saw some lucious burgers being served. Will have to try one next time.  Will definitely be back!

As with any outside venue, as a non-smoking asthmatic I appreciate adherence to the 50ft from door rule. I'm sure other non-poluters would appreciate as well. As seems to be the norm, smokers only care about smoking. I can appreciate that its an addiction, but think of others occasionally please.",positive,en
4,"First off, I am not a science person. Unless social sciences counts, in which case, I have a bachelors degree. My boyfriend on the other hand was raised by two Phd holding physicists and studied electrical engineering in college. He has weird accelerometer-type machines in his garage and has conversations that would make the cast of the Big Bang Theory proud. Kudos to the Arizona Science Center for offering exhibits that appealed to the both of us.

We started on the 4th floor at the Solarville exhibit which focused on energy, the environment, and conservation. It talked about individual household energy usage, and ways to reduce environmental impact. The 3rd floor had the Forces of Nature and Technology exhibits, which both offered interactive and informative displays. The 2nd floor was all about electricity, so naturally my electrical engineer bf showed off his knowledge. The coolest part of the museum for me was the first floor at the ""All About Me"" exhibit. It covers the systems of the human body and even has a stomach you can walk through and a giant nose that blows out objects. The neuroscience portion was very interesting, and I enjoyed taking the interactive memory tests.

Admission was $14, not including special exhibits or films. We had a limited amount of time and didn't get to check out any of the extras (IMAX film, planetarium, pirate exhibit). We saw almost all of the museum in 2 and half hours. We were there in the early afternoon on a weekday, and it seemed like most of the school groups had cleared out by then.

Will definitely be back, perhaps for the Adults Night Out. Nothing against kids, but I can only handle so many middle schoolers at time before I want to scream.",positive,en

4,"Everything about Coronado Cafe is charming and scrumptious.  It's my go-to place when I want to have a nice, but not fussy, lunch with a friend.  The menu has a lot of variety but not so much that it's overwhelming.  I've never been disappointed by the food.  The raspberry iced tea is delicious too! I like that they don't have any fried food, though my male friends don't so much appreciate that as they prefer fries with their burgers.  

Conversations can be challenging when dining inside-- the acoustics in an old house aren't the best to begin with, and then you cram it full of people and it gets a little noisy.  If you can't tune it out, the patio is a really lovely alternative. 

All in all, you really can't go wrong here!",positive,en
4,"I'm not sure if Safeway is a national thing (let's just say I've never seen one of these babies in Manhattan), but it's definitely needed in Phoenix and Tucson.

I would drive around the city, looking at all the strip malls and low-end manicure chop shops and wonder, ""Where the hell do people go grocery shopping?"" And while Trader Joe's is GREAT, I'd be hard-pressed to do all of my shopping there.

So thank God for Safeway, right? Although Safeway is generally a little more expensive than other grocery stores, you can pretty much get anything you need there. This particular location was so clean it was beaming! Or was that just me?

It had everything you'd expect from a Safeway--from a lovely floral department to a mini-Starbucks to a sizeable deli counter.

Yay for Safeway and chain shopping!",positive,en
5,"I almost NEVER give a chain restaurant a 5-star review, not because I'm opposed to the idea but because very few are worthy. But Bandera is just that good, from the upscale casual, relaxed and inviting atmosphere to the excellent service to the delicious food.

Ordering the cornbread to start is a must - it'd be a crime not to. The grilled artichoke and queso/guacamole apps are also wonderful. I had the macho salad, which was quite large and packed with good stuff. I also had a side of the mac and cheese that was outrageously good. Dessert offerings are limited to two choices, and neither blew me away, but the Oreo one was the better of the two.

Bandera is, like its sister restaurant Houstons, always a wonderful experience with reliably terrific food.",positive,en

2,"What happened to my sunday love the Orange Table? First off I have been going to this restaurant for sunday brunch forever (they have delicious mimosa's). However recently a friend of mine and I decided to grab some quick and yummy dinner here. The portions of the appetizers they are now serving to their patrons is just sad. The brie app I so love at this place was enough for two bites per person,which i assume they thought was ok because they cut up like two apples for us. If i were interested in cut up apple for an app i would have stayed home and eaten one, not gone to a restaurant and payed $10.00. The rest of the meal was just mediocre  to say the least, for a restaurant that only serves sandwiches you would think they would be absolutely incredible. The service that night was pathetic the staff there seemed less than eager to be working for Orange table.

4,"I have only been here once and it was for a quick drink before heading to a movie but this place is my kind of hang. 

If you are a laid back bar who supports local artists, has a huge selection of boozahol and plays music that makes my heart skip, well then I guess I just love you. Plus, its on the same street as my favorite Jobot Coffee, how could I not like The Lost Leaf right? I really love that it is a really old house turned into a bar. The artist inside me wants to shoot tons of photography there. Perhaps one day I will be ""that girl"" who brings her huge slr camera to the bar.

1,"I came to the restaurant specifically because of a recommendation. I am now on a gluten-free diet and have other allergies so, suffice it to say, I don't get to eat Italian often. However I was told that they have gluten-free pasta and other choices. I was initially impressed by the sheet that breaks down their meals by allergen so that one knows what is safe. Kudos on that. This is more than most places provide.

However, they have Basil Pesto Sauce listed as NOT being gluten-free nor soy free. Finding that odd, I asked the waiter to confirm with the chef, and I was told there was no wheat product at all in the pesto, which seems correct. (I did not ask about the soy, but I would wager that sneaks in somehow thanks to the cheese.)

So I ordered the Create Your Own Pasta of gluten-free penne with pesto sauce, shrimp, peppers, spinach, and mushrooms.

When my bowl of pasta arrived, it had all of the above. However, it also had onions, zucchini, and eggplant, yet I had to dig to find a shrimp. I originally assumed I had somebody else's order.

The waiter, who was wonderful and attentive, took the bowl away and offered to replace it as I ordered. I would have eaten the original bowl, and told him so, but I was more concerned, as I said, that it was someone else's.

As a side note, if these flourishes of extra vegetables are an example of a cook's flair, I would say that if a customer orders a straight menu item, that might be acceptable. But when I fill out a cute little checkbox form with what I want on my Create Your Own Pasta bowl, I *only* want the items I checked off.

A fresh bowl arrived later exactly as ordered. Except the pasta was undercooked. I don't mean really firm al-dente. I mean some were still way under done. Now, I know that gluten-free pasta takes longer to cook, and they probably rushed the bowl to get it to me. But that bowl was almost inedible.

The waiter did offer to get me a third bowl. I declined and soldiered through it. We were having dinner out for my wife's birthday and I did not want to belabor the meal. The waiter then offered us dessert to make up for the problems. Though I did agree to this, and I'm not demanding or even asking for a full dinner cost to be covered, it seems inadequate for management to offer me a three dollar dessert to make up for a twice-failed $14 dinner.  I do not intend to go back.",negative,en

5,"I had the terrible decision to make to euthanize my 20 year old cat, Bandit. I was going to go to the Emergency Animal Clinic off of Scottsdale Rd. further north but I had previously had a bad experience there. I saw there were some good reviews for this Emergency Animal Hospital and, thank God I did. They were so kind and compassionate. They let us take our time, never rushed us. They knew it was a very painful thing to have to do. They made one of the worst things I have ever had to do as 'easy' as they possibly could have. They eased my nagging doubts about it without putting words in my mouth. I am ever grateful for their kindness on that incredibly sad day and would recommend them to anyone who has an animal friend who needs some emergency care.",positive,en

1,"I can summarize this in one word.  YUCK!  We went for dinner/supper, which is part of the problem.  We ordered t-bone steak and chicken.  The salad bowl had a hole right through the plastic and the steak was way thin.  We ordered it medium and any steak that thin just ends up being cooked as ""well done"" anyway.  Everything comes with grease dripping hash browns whether you want them or not.  At least the staff was friendly enough and food (if you call it that) was served quickly.

3,"Firesky Resort is a marvelous place to unwind and enjoy the warm dry evening air and fire-lit torches.  Whenever I have the opportunity to stay in the Kimpton Hotel Group's locations, I always know I've made the right choice.  The hotel was beautiful, hip and inviting.  

I gave them three stars because the rooms were a nice, but not fabulous, the amenities of L'occitane products definitely helped.  The restaurant Taggio was fine, wasn't spectacular and definitely was the part of the hotel which was least memorable.

Average food. The burgers were average. The lettuce was wilted, the tomato was green, and nothing outstanding about the flavor. I'd say better options nearby are Joe's farm grill, In-n-out, or Culvers. 

Cleanliness was average. The floor was a little sticky and the beverage area was kept very neat. The kitchen appeared clean. 

Service was below average/horrible. The cashier was very unpleasant. We all ordered at the same time and the first half of the food came out about 15 minutes prior to the 2nd part. It was pretty slow. By the time we got the fries they were cold.

We ordered three different appetizers that were  on happy hour before our entrees. The Wontons, the queso dip, and the Chicken tenders. The tenders were good. They were beer battered and  tender. The queso dip was pretty bland and the chips awful. They weren't stale but just obviously super low quality. The Wontons were obviously frozen and sitting on a bed of syrup. It was like having desert and appetizers at the same time. When it came time to order entrees i was the last to do so. I asked my server about an option between three entrees and she danced around all of them suggesting that I have a pulled pork sandwich that was clearly less expensive than the ribs, steak or taco plate I inquired about. I should have headed her advice. It isn't every day a server tries to under sale you I ordered the ribs and was disappointed. the texture was off the flavor was bland except for the sauce which was spicy and not good enough to mask the bad flavor. My server Liz was awesome. She was attentive and friendly. She noticed I hadn't eaten my entree and took it away. The manager came back and was apologetic he offered me another entree and I took Liz's advice and got the pulled pork sandwich. It was much better. The staff was good and did there job very well.

5,"After weeks of anticipation, Side Bar has finally opened.  As you ascend the staircase to the second level, the reason for the long wait becomes apparent.  The attention to detail is amazing.  Once layered with crumbling plaster, the walls were meticulously stripped to reveal the historic brickwork.  Other historic elements include the original steel casement windows that feature a view of downtown phoenix and the surrounding area. Tastefully integrated with these elements is a contemporary interior design.  The lighting consists of warm colors that set the stage for the laid back atmosphere.  No expense was spared when designing the bar and tables, which are made of dark exotic woods.  Seating included organically shaped bar stools that adjust to a comfortable height and depth.  There are also several u-shaped sofas that create conversational areas.  Behind the bar you'll see an array of artistically arranged circular openings backlit in a warm, yellow tone.  Thick glass shelving lines the back wall along with a fine assortment of liquors.  The ""soft opening"" menu included wines and locally brewed beers among others.  I tried a White Russian and my wife had a glass of Chardonnay.  Both were very good.  Prices seemed to be close to average for the area and when compared to the experience, were a good value.  I had a chance to speak to one of the owners who was glowing with excitement.  After two years of remodeling and working with the city and adjacent historic neighborhood, his vision has become reality.  In addition to a brief history of his endeavor, the owner informed me that additional overflow parking will be available adjacent to the main parking lot.  Parking was one concern originally voiced by the neighborhood and city.  The owners may also experiment with weekly art showings by local artists.  Maybe they can arrange for it to coincide with First Fridays.  Within walking distance of Side Bar, dining includes Pei Wei, My Florist, and Zoe's Kitchen.

I think this Urban has a better selection for women than the one in Tempe, so if I had my choice, I'd come here to browse and buy.

What has the ability to take this place up a notch is karaoke. It draws a diverse crowd of headbangers to rappers to punks to cowboys, which is where the bizarro element comes in. Sometimes the mesh is weird and amazing in the David Bowie meets Trent Reznor way, other times its odd and off-putting.

3,"It is absolutely no fun to have a connection at this airport! It was definitely  not designed to be ""post-911"" friendly. Let me give you an example so that you will know what I mean: 

We fly in from San Francisco and are told that we will have to go to another building via a bus. We get off the plane and walk...and walk...and then walk some more, looking around trying to find where to go to in order to catch this bus. Finally, we found someone who told us where to go. We walked and walked, and then walked some more until we finally caught the bus. We then had to find the correct gate and go through security again... 

Flash forward 8 days. We fly in and go through customs. (This, BTW, was a great experience because we were the only international flight going through customs.) We rechecked our luggage and are told that we have to go to another building. Yep, you know what I am about to say...we floundered around, having to ask where to go several times. Finally, we found the right place and got on the bus. It then proceeded to go to various parking lots, dropping off and picking up other passengers. My husband and I looked at each other, worried that we were on the wrong bus. Since it was already 4 p.m. and we had not had lunch, we were getting very worried that we would not have time to grab lunch. 

Finally, my husband asked the driver and he indicated that we were indeed on the right bus. We continued going around parking lots until we came upon another bus. The driver told everyone on our bus that we could sit around and wait for 10-15 minutes, or we could get on the next bus and get there quicker. Of course, we all grabbed our suitcases and boarded the next bus, which proceeded to take us to the correct stop (after picking up additional passengers along the way.) 

Next ,we entered the terminal and jumped on an elevator to take us to the security line. There were only 2 lines and of course, we got in the line with the family who had to go back 6 or 7 times because they kept trying to go through the security line with belts on, shoes on, liquids in  their suitcases...you get the picture! 

Anyway, we finally got to our gate and were able to grab a slice of pizza before boarding our plane (not before enduring the antics of a 70-year-old United Airlines power-hungry granny who couldn't seem to get her act together, but was determined to show everyone who was boss...)",neutral,en

I thought the waitstaff was excellent and very helpful every time I went there, and their menu has some really great choices. The bar was very nice and clean and the outside patio is pretty awesome.

-Virtually any sport you want to watch, they'll have it on one of their many TVs for you.  
-Strong drinks, made correctly. Their bartenders are great.
-The staff is very friendly and usually quite attentive.
-Patio seating is plentiful, along with a firepit for the winter and misters for the summer.
-Bouncers at the door know their stuff and will take out a crazy drunk before you even have to ask.

The Bad: 
-The food really isn't very good. Most of it is run-of-the-mill bar food that came out of a package and tastes like crayons (bland and boring). Their garlic fries and cheese sticks are delicious though.
-It can get very crowded on big game nights, and as such service can get very slow or the servers may even not be told you've been seated (the hostesses aren't great).
-Sometimes at night they play the music ridiculously loud - it's a bar, not a dance club. No one goes there to sit and not hear their company.

Go There For: A sports game with your friends to drink.
Don't Go There For: A hearty meal with grandma after church on Sunday.",neutral,en
5,"Overall I am a big fan of this place... first how can you beat a place that is BYO???!!!  You never have to worry about a bad wine list or paying too much because it is your own stuff...  I find the food excellent... they menu is not large and changes often...  but I have never had anything that I have no liked... the chef is defiantly 5 star and since you bring in your own wine the prices don't seem that bad... but it is not exactly cheap... 

The only down fall of the place is that it is real small and has funky hours... I think it is only open Wednesday to Saturday.  I know that they take reservations and I would venture to say that is the only way to actually eat there... This is a nice place for special occasions or a date...",positive,en
4,"This is about as good as it gets for Asian food in this price range.  The chicken isn't chewy like many other inexpensive Asian restaurants.  I've had several of their dishes and without a doubt the Yakisoba with chicken is my favorite.  I love the white-meat chicken and broccoli (with Teriyaki sauce).  The broccoli is quality, and never overcooked.  And I love their Teriyaki sauce.",positive,en
4,"Thank God that The Vig wasn't open when I lived just down the street!  I would've lived there!  I was back in town in the fall and after brunch across the street at Dick's we needed MORE post-brunch champers.  Over to The Vig we went.  

How darn cute!  When I lived in Phoenix, this was a BofA training center and my standard ATM spot.  I like it better as The Vig.  We enjoyed many, many of the $5 mimosas with your choice of fresh juices (orange, grapefruit, strawberry or watermelon).  Yummy!  We stayed so long and drank so many mimosas that we had to order nachos.  They were really tasty.

Sitting out on the patio in late October in short sleeves with friends and champagne was delightful for this Chicagoan.",positive,en

Come with a group of friends, whether for dim sum or a late night dinner.  You need a group of people, I hate coming here when its just mean and three others.  I like to taste and sample lots of goodies.  They have great live seafood (a must in my book) where you can walk by and see what looks good that day.  Be brave and check it out!",positive,en
4,"I have been wanting to try Big Daddy's since it opened and finally today was the day for some lunch there! 

I was expecting cold mac and cheese based on some of the reviews, so imagine my surprise when it burned six layers of flesh off my tongue. 

The mac was HOT, the sweet potato fries were HOT and my pulled pork was HOT, so I do not see what the fuss is about. The fries are a little on the heavy, sweet  side so I could only eat a few but they are pretty good. The mac was dreamy and thank you for including some of the browned/burnt crusty stuff from the top... mmm I am a simple man and easily pleased, I guess.  

Overall I can't give it 5 stars because I think it's a tad overpriced, but I still think the value is good. I'll be back to work my way through some ribs and wings and wash down with beer next time...",positive,en
3,"My husband and I ate here for lunch as we were waiting for our room to be ready (we were checking in early).  The restaurant is very inviting and I liked the decor.  We had a great window seat the overlooked the outdoor terrace and the mountains in the background was lovely!    The hostess was very friends and our waiter was attentive and fairly personable.  

I ordered the Beet & Goat Cheese salad with Grilled Chicken and it was quite good!  Even though I liked it very much, I would only give it a 3 out of 5 because they didn't use Roasted Beets...I believe that they were canned beets.   Still good, but roasted beets would have knocked it out of the park!  The salad had spinach, mild goat cheese, mandarin oranges, red onion, and delicious candied pecans....with a balsamic vinaigrette.  It was a very good salad.  I wished I had ordered the small serving though because it was a large salad!  The 

My Husband ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich with fries.  The fries were SO good!  The sandwich was equally good, but spicy from the roasted pablano that was on it.

Net-net....it was a very good lunch, but I can only give it 3 stars because it cost us $40 for a salad, a sandwich, a soda (I had water),and gratuity.  For $40.00 for lunch, it should have been outstanding, not just very good.  I get that it's in a resort, but still.",neutral,en

They have multiple things going on all times of the year, from guided bird watching to night-time observatory star gazing. The preserve is a little sanctuary of nature and beauty within the confines of our sprawling metropolis and I absolutely love it. 

What I especially enjoy is how the Gilbert Public Library looks out to the preserve with its giant floor-to-ceiling windows. So even when it's sweltering in the dead of summer, you can still go to the preserve and enjoy the beauty while reading a book in the library.",positive,en

The sushi lunch deal was *amazing.*  Piping hot miso, delicate seaweed salad, crisp cucumber salad, flavorful sauteed veggies, fresh orange slices and the main attraction - tuna, yellowtail and salmon all absolutely fresh and perfectly prepared.  I left totally stuffed and happy.  One caveat - they should turn down the music a little during lunch; happy hour should be one level of noise and lunch should be several octaves below that.",positive,en

Overall, this is a great place to dine at, small little romantic place with good music also. A little pricey, but I believe it's worth it for the atmosphere, food, and friendly service. :)",positive,en
5,"I've got two names for you:  TYLER & MARCO - - superstar instructors at the Y!!!

I've been an avid gym member at various gyms for years and I have to say, the YMCA downtown can't be beat for the 8-5 p.m. work schedule person who likes to attend the gym during lunch or right after work.  I'm all about the group exercise classes and this Y offers an array of classes such as spin, kickboxing, Zumba, Yogalates, Boot camp, water aerobics, Hatha Yoga, etc., etc.

Back to my fav instructors:  Tyler and Marco.  Boy, do these boys kick my ass every time I take their classes! Tyler teaches spin and offers not only strong knowledge and great tips on making your spin experience the best that it can be, he has a kick-ass playlist of music to motivate his class.  Marco is a very intense and interactive kickboxing instructor who keeps pushing you with great music mixes to keep his class sweating the weight and stress away.

Thank you Tyler and Marco for making my workouts intense and fun!  After years of going to different aerobic classes, I'm FINALLY seeing the results!!

Clothes at J Crew are more expensive than your typical store but you are paying for quality clothing.  Many dresses and skirts purchased elsewhere have hit the dust as my J Crew pencil skirts and blouses stand unscathed.  Need shoes to complete the outfit?  Maybe a sparkling accessory?  J Crew has you covered.

I've been a huge fan of Houston's for years, and had mixed emotions when I heard that they were closing the Phoenix location and opening just down the street under their parent company name, Hillstone.  But after one visit, I'm sold... 

Hillstone has the same favorite dishes that Houston's had (spinach dip, grilled artichoke, veggie burger, fresh vegetable sides, fries, desserts, etc...) and they have a huge wine list as well.  Service is attentive and sweet (thanks McKenna who was our waitress last night).  Thanks also for going above and beyond and creating rootbeer floats for our table upon request!

The Hillstone group did a fabulous job building this new restaurant - it's got a great outdoor seating area, a huge bar, an awesome wine cellar, and comfy booths inside as well.

2,"This is a cool place for low key hanging out, killing time, chatting and relaxing with friends.  It is NOT a good night spot and doesn't work as an event venue like they seem to be trying to make it.

I've attended 2 events there and its basically a disaster in trying to make your way through the 200-300 patrons they bring in.  You get funneled in past the food trailer into the bar area which is packed with people standing among several oversized tables.  Only if you've been there before can you figure out that you can walk towards the boxing ring past the crowd to get behind the stage and into the retail area.  Once there you have to get a spot among the wares to watch the back (or the side) of the show that is going to take place facing the bar.  Both times I stood the entire night with my drink next to a display of $50 t-shirts.  Very nerve wracking and annoying.

1.  The old timey way they make drinks is very cool and the drinks are delicious but I have waited now 35 and 45 minutes each on different nights to actually get a single mixed cocktail.  Its insane how slow it is.

2.  There are rules to what you can get at which station.  One spot is just wine.  Another spot is just mixed drinks.  Lemonade - oh thats a different place entirely.  

3.  They use the boxing ring as the ""stage"" for shows.  Very hard to view the show there because of the odd angle its at.  Both times I've had to stand in the retail area while the performers faced the seating/bar area (which only seats about 75 people).

To pay more than $10 to see a performance at this place is outrageous.  If the owners want to be an event venue they could do it simply by doing some rearranging and investing in some more seating.",negative,en

5,"Inside the Clarendon Hotel in central Phoenix, Gallo Blanco has quickly made a hit for themselves with hipsters and urban dwellers alike. They offer a refreshing alternative for hotel restaurants, with lively ambiance and great food and drink.

Gallo Blanco's tacos are surefire hits. They're served individually, and come lined up in an appealing silver taco stand. We've ordered the carne asada and shrimp soft tacos, and, wow, they're really mouthwatering. The shrimp is flame grilled and seared, bringing out a nice full flavor. The guacamole is slightly sweet and chunky, and paired with outstanding tortilla chips, this is a must-order appetizer. Even the sauces (I prefer the red chipotle one) are addictive, either to accompany the supreme tacos, or to be enjoyed alone on chips.

This restaurant is a fine addition to the emerging downtown Phoenix foodie scene, and with prices extremely reasonable, you get a lot. A good sized meal for two (sans drinks) could ring up at $30-35, which is a good value for great food. Try Gallo Blanco, bring friends, and get a bunch of items. Although I haven't explored the rest of the menu, I sense that Gallo Blanco's items don't stray far from excellence.",positive,en

My mom, my dad, my sister, my nephew, and I all thoroughly enjoyed our meals. I had the Triple Stack of New Mexican style Enchiladas. One shredded beef and two Carne Adovada. It was SO delicious! The red sauce at Blue Adobe is unparalleled and unlike any other. My dad had the Chorizo stuffed Chicken Breast and loved it. My mom had the seafood enchiladas with halibut salmon and shrimp and she inhaled those. And my sister had the Chile Rellenos and couldn't stop saying how tasty they were.

2,"I stayed here last month. It's your average motel (since the doors face outside, not a hallway), and the breakfast buffet is okay (scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage links, bacon, cereal, batter to make waffles,   and toast provided). The walls are REALLY thin, so thin that the guy snoring next door kept us awake all night. 

The room was clean and equipped with a mini fridge (like the kind you'd keep in your dorm room) and microwave, although lacking a safety deposit box. If you want to keep your items safe, you have to bring your items to the front desk, make a list of what you're dropping off, and then sign. I was uncomfortable making a list, so I decided to forgo this process.

FYI if you call the front desk to order you a taxi, they actually order a car service. The car is an unmarked, dark-colored Lincoln sedan. To go to the 16th Street Sports Bar down the street cost us about $10 vs $6 for an actual taxi (which we ended up taking later). We didn't want to drink and drive, so not bad, but just know that the hotels in the area do not order taxis.

My main complaint is that we didn't have housekeeping service the entire time, hence the two stars. We left for lunch from 10:30AM - 1:30PM, returned, but housekeeping never arrived. We left again at 3PM for the rest of the day, and housekeeping, upon arrival back at the room after midnight, hadn't come. I called the front desk for someone to bring towels, but since there was no one to cover the front desk, we had to go get the towels ourselves. I also wanted an extra pillow, but the front desk person couldn't leave the front desk to get a pillow out of the housekeeping room. I thought this was very strange.

I guess for less than $100/night (Hilton resort down the street much more expensive), it's not too bad. I would probably stay here again for the mere fact that the location is conducing to our activities. But, if I could find another hotel close by with a similar price, I wouldn't mind staying somewhere else.",negative,en
4,"More like 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding up because the overall property was so nice.

Good Food, Good Service, Good View (overlooking the golf course).

I had the Chicken Caprese sandwich which was quite tasty, but the burger my mom has was WAY better.  If you go here.... order a burger.  They are big, juicy and super duper good.  It's also super duper messy.  It's a ""fork and knife"" type of burger. 

Their bloody mary is pretty good... a little too tomato-y.... needed more seasoning.

Mom's John Daly Peach drink was refreshing.  Good for cooling off and relaxing after a round of golf.  :)

Tater Tots were served with our sandwiches and they were good... but nothing all that special.  They were crunchy on the outside and soft and hot on the inside... but for this type of establishment.... I would have expectetd Truffle Tots or something different.

The baked goods are baked right there in the coffee house, by their employees.  The coffee is roasted right there, on site. Iced tea refills are free, bitches. The baristas are hep cats who ride fixie bikes. Now, I like to coast, but shit...  Gotta give them cred. If you go often enough, the other regulars will be friendly. If you hate Mac laptops, you probably should stay away. The new tables are great. There are power outlets everywhere. It's next to Pane Bianco. I run into my homies there on the regular. When it comes to coffee shops in CenPho, there is no competitor. Jeff, the owner, is a cool dude. The seating outside is nice. I have been known to spend all day there, and use it as my office away from home and my real office.

2,"The queso is ridiculously good... seriously. And the homemade tortillas are also outstanding.

Aside from that, everything is average at best. As mentioned by others, this is Americanized Mexican cuisine. This is not autentica comida Mexicana, mi amigos!

We had been once before and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Hence making it a point to visit again on our most recent trip to Arizona.

We started with the chips and salsa set for the table - delicious. I ordered a bunch of queso for the table, and I started with a Tortilla Soup. It was hilariously underwhelming. I made the joke that it was kitchen scraps, and it looked the part. It was light tomato broth with a bunch of vegetables, a gob of cheese and a small corn on the cob on top. Yes, a small corn on the cob is on top. It was lousy and I wouldn't recommend it.

We ordered a pound of chicken fajitas and a half pound of vegetable ones (thanks to the vegetarian fiancee). It went surprisingly far for five of us... but the veggies weren't grilled much, which is sad because they were otherwise delicious. Also, the chicken fajitas only had one piece of green pepper and one of red on top. It should be lush with peppers and onions that have been grilled or possibly even caramelized (the onions).

Daniel E. wrote in his review the same concern, that there should be ""more than a pile of onions,"" that he expected at least some green, red or yellow peppers. The fajitas were good and quite filling. The accompaniments were decent - cheese, lettuce, sour cream and the like. Nothing fancy, certainly no frills.

So much potential, but it fails on almost everything. It's a true shame. This place needs to be on Restaurant Impossible with Robert Irvine... badly...

This time around... the service was really lousy. And my fiancee found a bug deep down in her water. Very disappointing. The waitress first replied confirming what size bug it was, and then explained it and claimed that ""we're not dirty, it's just the food smell."" Then she apologized and walked away. We think she deducted a soda from the final bill... but nothing else. A bug!

And the entry foyer smelled like a high school locker room... it was foul on the way in and out.

Sad to say that we may likely not return in the future. I'm not sure if our family and friends in the greater Phoenix area will either after the bug incident.",negative,en

Here is my first Yelp. Please don't judge. It's my first time.... Okay, here goes. So, I went to Matt's for the first time a few days ago....

Food- Amazing.  Best pancakes ever! I'm not sure what the secret ingredient is but they are beyond good! Fluffy little cakes of love. I also tasted the butter burger. Very, very, yummy. If you decide to dine here make sure you try the bacon. I don't think I've ever tasted anything like it. Sweet, savory and cooked just right.

The building is very small, the wait is extra long and make sure you don't overindulge on the free refills of ice tea because there is NO BATHROOM!! The seating is cramped and the service is rushed, but the food is worth dealing with Matt's shortcomings.",positive,en
3,"I visited one Sunday afternoon just to check it out in reply to an ad I saw to visit for free for (5) days. Typically, when you respond to ads like that from a gym, the staff requests your information such as name, address, & phone so they can sell you on a membership later. That was not the case with me. It was very informal. I advised I was not a member and wanted to give their place a shot. The guy in the front desk said come right on in; no personal information requested and no tour. I'm glad there was no sales pressure. I thought the no tour part was kind of odd, but after doing my walk through, I understand why. The place is not very big. They have weights and cardio machines and the treadmills each had a personal television on the machine. The whole facility appeared clean and there were free towels for the taking for your workout. The lockers in the men's locker room were really nice. They were made brown wood. You can view a sample of the interior of the facility on their website. They looked really classy, but they were not free. There were cabinets offered outside of the locker rooms that you can keep your personals in with a latch that allows you to insert your personal lock on. There was also a small room for classes.

I wasn't very impressed with this gym mainly because it was very small. I came during a Sunday afternoon when most gyms don't see much traffic so I don't know what it's like during normal high traffic periods such as early mornings and after 5pm on weekdays. I would imagine that due to the small size of this gym that they cater more to the very local crowd. I wouldn't give this location a poor rating because there wasn't really anything that stood out that was negative other than the limited space and equipment. You might think of this location as the alternative to the larger chain gyms like 24 Hour Fitness, LA Fitness, or Lifetime Fitness. You can always take a look for yourself; apparently, they don't provide too much sales pressure for visitors. Anyway, that's my say on Mountainside Fitness at Bell Rd in North Scottsale next to the Ice Den skating rink.",neutral,en
2,"the pedicure was nice, I will give them that... but lady must have wanted 2 close shop early that day as I told her I wanted a pedi & an acrylic manicure when I first walked in. (She asked another customer to come back the next day while I was getting pedi). Needless to say, I didn't get my acrylic set, and towards the end, I could tell she was 1/2 arsing it... and they were a lil pricey... I mean, really, $5 for taking off my nail polish? I would give this place 1 star, but they did do a good job on the pedicure. not returning here...",negative,en

3,"Lately, I've been on the hunt for a good shrimp po boy. I'm not sure if this compulsion was spurred by homesickness for New Orleans, the food challenge show featuring 2 famous NOLA po boy joints, or both but I've it seems the last few weekends I've found myself dreaming of that crusty bread ""dressed"" with lettuce, tomato, and mayo, and golden deep fried gulf shrimp. I happened to notice Baby K's one day and decided to try it out. To be honest, I wasn't even really that hungry but I wanted the po boy and I didn't know when or if I'd have the opportunity to go back to Town and Country mall any time in the near future. The inside was empty but they have a French
Quarter-esque patio complete with wrought iron fence. The bf and I both ordered the half pb with a cup of gumbo. I'm a bit of a gumbo snob bc I feel I can make it better than any restaurant can but theirs was really good! They had 3 different kinds which was nice and it was seasoned perfectly. There wasn't a bite that didn't have meat in and the broth was just right. The shrimp on the pb was succulent and almost tasted as if it was battered in beignet mix as the fried was light and airy. I didn't indulge in any libations but they do have Abita and a few other New Orleans beer classics. If I find myself in the area again I'd probably go back but this time I'm ordering a whole po boy!",neutral,en

Charlie Levy who booked for the now legendary Nita's Hideaway and also the owner of Stateside Presents is the man behind it all! He is a music fan first and ... well ... that's just what he is ... a music fan not a natural businessman. 

The place is just beautiful (for now, soon to be broken with the wear and tear of rock and roll no doubt). The room is small ... stage big (for the size) ... no doubt this is going to be the best place in the city to see any band for a long time to come!

Thank you Charlie!

I had the best Greek salad that I've ever had, and I will agree with one review that it was definitely too light on the feta. 

The service was great, food was excellent, and while it may have been a bit on the pricey side I felt as though it was a great value. Not one of the places I would take out-of-towners and rave about, but a great little spot to hit for lunch.",positive,en

My standard meal is a California Carne Asada burrito, it comes with the most tender carne asada I've ever had.

Guac is exceptional, and they also have really tasty breakfast burritos that are available all day. Five stars for being consistent, clean and for having pleasant and professional employees! One more thing is that they close at midnight except for Sunday when they close at 10. Bummer but still the best!",positive,en
4,"I went here with my husband last Sunday afternoon.  We had a 2 for 1 coupon out of the Entertainment guide.  We are from San Diego and have been trying to find Mexican food places similar to the food out in San Diego.  We pulled up to the location and were debating if we should go in or not.  The area wasn't the best, and it was in a tiny strip mall.  Kind of looked like a taco shop.  We decide to go in, because we were starving.  Inside it looked completely different.  It was a little dark and dated.  But the atmosphere was very causal and the hosts were super nice.  We sat down and right away got some nice warm chips, salsa and beans served to us.  I was feeling like a margarita and was going to get the house one, when the waitress said they had 99 cent margaritas available.  We ordered our food and didn't have to wait very long to get it.  Super good food and really cheap 99 cent margaritas. The margaritas were served in pretty nice size glasses but a bit strong.  FYI, I think you're getting really cheap alcohol in there, seemed pretty stiff. I started buzzing after my second glass.   My husband even loved the Chile reino that he tried from my plate.  He usually doesn't like it at all.  The carne asada was seasoned very well, it was a great change from some of the bland Mexican food I've had out here in phoenix. My husband had the beef chimichanga and it was seasoned really well also.  For the price you can't beat it.  From the outside the restaurant seems a little ghetto looking, but once you get inside it's pretty nice in there.  I would defiantly try it again.",positive,en
4,"I have to admit, the reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 3 is a) I want it to stay in business (which can be hard on Mill these days!) and b) It's one of the few places on Mill where you can bring your child without feeling like you may get heckled. ;) lol Now, I definately enjoy a night out without the babes too, but this is a place I go for happy hour with my husband and daughter.

5,"I absolutely LOVE Club SAR! I joined back in 2010 (I think...). At first, I just went there with my ex (who lived in So Cal and had been boxing) because I have always loved the sport of boxing and wanted to get into it myself (maybe even join the boxing team).  Sadly, I exceeded the age limit to join the boxing team, by a few years...  :-(
But, at least I could still learn and get fit.  :-)
We just walked up to the entrance and just took one quick look around and it seemed crowded and small so we were not impressed. So, we left.
I found out this used to be just a boxing gym before but eventually they added other classes and equipment for others to enjoy. 

Glad I went back later on my own and found out how affordable it was!
I checked and tried a few other Fitness centers and gyms nearby but, when I decided to actually try one of Club SAR's boxing classes, I was hooked! For a mere $3  (a day) drop-by fee, I was able to get one of the best workouts I ever had. I joined after I found out it only cost $75 for the whole YEAR which includes ALL the classes I can take (Boxing, boxing conditioning, Yoga, spin class, kickboxing, weight training, MMA... Yes! MMA too, which I personally love.  :-) ). Jonathan & Carlos are great and so is Tom. They're funny, friendly, and they actually remember you after only a few classes. 
The pricing has gone up this year but it is still by far, the BEST possible deal you can find anywhere in the Valley. 

Fees 
 
YEARLY Membership  Resident    Non-Resident 
Adult (18+ years)       $99                  $150 
Child (14-17 years)    $50                  $75 
Daily Drop-In Fee $3 Residents; $5 Non-Residents
 
If you are serious about getting fit, staying in shape and getting a good old-fashioned workout without all the ""posing"" and pretentiousness of other gyms which are more like ""meeting places"" and ""meat markets"" for the young Scottsdale wannabes, this gym is definitely for you!

Personally, I recommend the boxing classes because they will kick your butt, they are fun, get you fit and, in shape. :-)
They just got new heavy bags so there are 2 heavy bags, 1 hooks bag, several ""Bob bags"", 2- double-ended bags and 3 speed bags in the main workout areas. Plus, a bunch more standing weighted-base heavy bags in the other ""kickboxing/Yoga room. And, in case you didn't notice from the picture, a full-size boxing ring. 
Yes. I am totally endorsing this gym! 

P.S. This is a ""no frills"", serious gym. 
So, no whinnying and crying. Suck it up and do some push-ups!  ;-)

3,"I ordered the gyro.

THE GOOD:
1. Well spiced gyro meats, but a tad too greasy for my tastes. You also get a reasonable portion, which is always appreciated.
2. The pita bread was rather tasty as well. Slightly chewy, though.
3. Not too expensive.
4. Friendly owners.

THE BAD:
1. A little piece of tomato and a few paper-thin pieces of onions. If you love onions in your gyro, ask for some extra onions on the side.
2. Again, it's a bit greasy. Even for a gyro.

THE SO-SO:
1. The tzatziki isn't that flavorful, but I enjoy a definite garlicky presence to my tzatzik'. It was decent, but afterwards I wasn't lapping up every last bit from the little plastic container like a hungry dog.

All in all, I'll probably return if I'm in the area and crave a gyro.",neutral,en
4,"This place is awesome!  Where else can you hear incredible live jazz music for free on a Monday night with reasonably priced drinks?  Any other major city (like, say, New York), the cover would be at least $15, and they would make you pay for the second set, as well, and a place to sit or stand with a decent view of the musicians would be hard to come by, and by the end of the night you would end up feeling ripped off.  

Granted, this place can get crowded on the weekends, but no wonder.  The beer (no draft) and wine selection is good, the vibe is laid-back, and the music I've heard has been great (I've only see one group here--Jiggle--and they play jazz.)

Tip for music-lovers:  Sit or stand in the room where the music is.  Sitting any farther back and you may be tempted to take a swing at the people who just come to chat and fail to understand what makes the Lost Leaf so unique.  But do give them a bit of a break.  They are, after all, probably ""paying"" for your cover charge with all their imbibing of alcohol.",positive,en

The hot and sour soup surprised me - I'm not normally a very big soup fan but I thoroughly enjoyed it both at the restaurant and as left-overs the next day.

It's Philipino food which I had never had before and I wasn't sure what to order so I just said a word that I hoped was right. Turns out I got the pork egg rolls. I overheard another patron say they were good for Philipino food beginners. Perfect!

The lady in the truck was very sweet. I paid $8 for 3 pork egg rolls, scoop of rice, some stringy things, and a bottled Coke. Average price for Food Truck Friday. I enjoyed the rolls though. They were steaming hot but the pork inside was delicious. The outside was very crunchy and flakey. I adored it!",neutral,en
4,"My sister took me here last week its crazy that I haven't been yet right? This is her regular go to place. Not much I can say after so many reviews here already. The patio looked very nice I bet its the place to be when its cooler. It was kind of empty in here but it was late afternoon. My sis ordered us some Drunken Italian Sodas they were made super strong though usually this would not detour me however I had my child with me and had to drive all the way back home after. Basically it tasted like straight vodka in a giant glass it was a bit much for me mid day and after adding Sprite to it which I stole from my daughter I still couldn't drink it without feeling like I'd be a drunken Mexican after. I didn't understand this drink maybe someone can explain it to me? My sis told me their Sangria was good but I had no idea they made Caipirinha's next time that's what I get no question.
 The food: We had the garlic lemon hummus it was really good the ingredients separately didn't have much taste to them but together it was really nice the pita bread was excellent. The kid couldn't stop eating the hummus she got so full she barely touched her mac n cheese so we brought that home along w all the leftover hummus. Now on to the Tejano burger we decided to split. OMG it was so delicous I couldn't put it down and we both regretted having split it w each other. Extra star just for that burger alone you best try it if you haven't son!!!",positive,en

2,"When I saw this place pop up along the everyday path home, I had such great hopes.  I was counting the days until I was able to hit this place for a nice weekday lunch.

With an such and ostentatious name as ""The Scottsdale Salad Company"", I was oh so stoked about a genuine alternative...  I envisioned crazy vegan vigilance, staunch environmental activism and a ridiculous gargantuan AYCE salad buffet teaming with fresh usuals and exotic fare.  I would stuff myself into lunch coma with all manner of crazy nosh all while maintaining some personal self-image of ""health"" under the guise of a ""salad bar"".  Glorious.

Alas, I was so, so disappointed.

It's basically a shell of a quick-serve Chinese restaurant very slightly skinned to be a basic eatery.  The place was virtually empty at high-noon on a Tuesday.  I ordered the large Parisian Salad and a soda.  I was expecting a freshly tossed salad piled high on a plate with a flourish deserving of the name ""The Scottsdale Salad Co.""!!  Rather, I got a pre-packed romaine lettuce and cabbage bomb in a plastic clamshell.  Oh, my soda was a nice styrofoam cup I filled on the fountain machine.  All for about $10.  Food cost couldn't have been more than $2 even if purchased from Costco next door.  I certainly wasn't paying for the ambiance.  Lame.

A couple people there got a wrap, which appeared to be emaciated and a general poor excuse for a wrap which I'd like to pay money for at a restaurant.  I could make the same lame roll at home for about $1.

As is, this place is simply another ticking timebomb of another indy resturant failure.  If the owners take a risk and venture to be more than service station food, they might have a prayer...",negative,en
1,"My rating is based on the fact that as a vegetarian, they charge $8 for a small mediocre bean burrito.  Maybe if this bean burrito were exceptionally good or large in size, but it was neither.  I'm not saying that if your idea of Mexican food is Chipolte, you will not find what you are looking for and be happy here. But if what you offer your vegetarian customers is deleting the meat and not adding anything else and charging full price, I can get MUCH BETTER elsewhere and pay way less.

His comments: 
* Salad was good - we had the spinach & Gorgonzola salad. 
* Pizza was really good, but too expensive. Plus, it was the thinner type so you wouldn't expect to pay that much.
* Wait staff - not good. 
* Ambiance - pretty nice. Has a NY type of feeling.
* Too pricey to go back

My comments: 
* Salad had too much dressing. It was dripping with the balsamic stuff. I don't like soppy lettuce.
* Pizza was just ok. It was served to us fairly quickly considering that the place was packed. However, it was not hot. Plus, we had to wave our server down to ask her to heat it up. She didn't seem very happy with us and did not offer an apology for the cold pie. After all, this place is called Humble Pie. 
* Wait staff - Not good. Not very forthcoming with the menu and only seemed to be interested in getting the ordering over with.
* The staff should be humble enough to ask the customer if everything is ok after the food is served. That never happened. Even when she brought over the check we got nothing. 
* Ambiance - too loud and dark! Tables and chairs are packed tight in this place so plan to share your space with others not in your party. 
* Definitely not going back. 

We paid $34 plus tip for a small Cesar salad, pizza with three toppings, soft drink and glass of wine. Too much money for some Si's food.",neutral,en

But the samples of food were few and far between. The Servers skipped out many times. Not like most Yelp events which are usually out the door GREAT!  We ordered from the happy hour menu.  I fully agree lots of salt, but i think it was the soy sauce, it was the most salty..i have ever had. There is very little parking here as well so be prepared for that as well.

My only criticism is that the waffles I got were a bit on the thin side. I've had chicken and waffles from many different soul food places all over the US and in comparison LoLo's waffles were just okay. The chicken on the other hand was A+. It was tender and juicy and well fried.

I accidentally poked my eye with a branch yesterday and knew I had damaged it so I went to the Gilbert Costco optician and asked if I could be seeing on an emergency basis. The receptionist asked me if I could come back in 5 hours to which I stated it was an emergency and could asked the Dr if she could see me. She asked her and she said no she did not have time.
I find it very unbelievable that on an emergency basis they can turn someone away who has a Costco optics patient for years. I recognize that she had a patient at the time but I said I could wait until after so she could at least take 5 minutes to tell me if I should go to a hospital or not.

4,"My boyfriend and I decided to drive around Scottsdale and find a place for dinner on a Saturday night. Our initial impression of the place was that it was going to be too rich for our blood; however, we figured we would give it a shot. The decor reminded my boyfriend of nightclub scene from Scarface. 

When they sat us down initially we were right next to the kitchen which wasn't too pleasant. So we asked to be moved to another location and the hostess moved us into their private dinning room which we loved. 

Our server was very friendly and informative, yet also gave us space. We ordered crab cakes to start things off. They were excellent but slightly over priced given the portion size. Then we ordered a bottle of wine that was very reasonably priced and to our liking for $24 - a nice Argentinian Malbec. We decided on this bottle after our server brought us several other tastes. I ordered the soup of the day and my boyfriend got a caesar salad. Both were solid. For entrees I got a salmon with asparagus and my boyfriend ordered seared ahi tuna. Both were cooked to perfection.

Overall, being in the private dining room was perfect, noise level wise, and all of the staff made sure everything was up to par without being too over zealous. I would highly recommend this place.",positive,en

I had no idea I would miss it so much when I returned to the states. Luckily, with one internet search I came upon Villa Peru. It was EXCELLENT. I did not expect ceviche in AZ to be so fresh and delicious! And not only that, but they also served it with proper cancha and Inca Kola is a beverage option (which of course I had to order). 
Unfortunately, I have to give my experience 4 stars instead of 5 because they were out of Aji de Gallina, which is what my brother had his heart set on for dinner that night. And also because it took a little longer to get the check than it should have due to an apparent disagreement between the owner or manger & server.

My husband and I have never been more insulted at a restaurant than tonight at the Hillstone Restaurant (Biltmore).
This is the same restaurant group that includes Bandera and Houston's. 

We deliberately went out early-- at 5pm -- with another couple and our son. He started to fuss on and off during dinner. Mind you the restaurant was already noisy when the GM Miranda Geranios instructed us to leave; other patrons were complaining. That was news to us- and we've seen far worse outbursts in the past from children. Ironically, our son at that moment was playing happily with the other couple when she rudely asserted herself. 

We were in the middle of dinner and to add insult to injury, she didn't even offer to compensate us for a future visit without our little guy. Just go home without dinner and pay the bill. Of course, she herself has no children. 
To ask a repeat customer to leave is absolutely disgusting. We will never visit any of their establishments again and wanted to share our unfortunate experience with our friends who also know the challenges of having a family.",negative,en

The ""Veal 2 Ways"" and ""Braised Oxtail"" were phenomenal.... a great combination of flavors and texture.   I think I'd put them both in my list of Top 10 dishes.   

I can't wait to travel back to Phoenix to eat there again.    I'll also add the I really like the atmosphere.   Very chill place, but elegant without being stuffy.",positive,en
2,"The service at this location was great, until one of the servers managed to incorporate throwing up in into a conversation while I was nursing a hangover. Never a good idea to talk throwing up to a customer that is eating.duh!! This conversation led to more inappropriate words from the employee until he finally left....grrrrr!!!

Had the biscuits& gravy special ( $10.95 ), no bueno. I like my gravy simple...just some gravy with a little sausage running through,thats it. Can't stand it when there is onions, peppers, celery, carrot...yuck!! And they served those generic potatoes that are big flavorless cubes that they put in the deep fryer. Should have just had the chicken and waffle, lesson learned.",negative,en
4,"I know little about Ethiopian food. I'm an adventurous eater, and was taken here to try it. And I must say, now, that I am a fan! 

The food was very cheap, and incredibly flavorful. So, if you're on a budget, and want to either impress a date with your culture, or are a foodie, this is a great place to try! I am writing it only as 4 stars only because I haven't tried any other Ethiopian food. However, I pretty much don't want to risk tr.ying another place ;)

The Ethiopian tea they serve is fantastic, along with your meal. The portions are generous, along with generous amount of of injera. We has more than enough food around us, and left stuffed.

The dish that especially impressed me, was the curry chicken. So much so, that I continually kept enjoying the injera in the sauce. 

All the vegetarian food was delicious! I, unfortunately, don't remember the names of everything, but the greens were some of the best I've ever had, along with a lentil dish. 

Also, I rated this good for kids, however, that's only because I have a toddler that eats anything! If you don't have problems feeding your kid unique food, I suggest an attempt!

In short, if you're a big food fan, or want to be a little more adventurous on your food options, especially for a great, fair price, try Blue Nile!!",positive,en

3,"I met a friend for lunch yesterday. 

Loved the water feature and patio walking in, if it had been warmer I would have definitely sat outside. 

Inside was a little dark and I guess it was all the bats around but it reminded me of ""Dusk Till Dawn"". 

We were seated, I hope was hoping for chips and salsa, I guess they don't serve them here? 
We weren't even offered the ones on the menu, which I probably would have declined anyway because chips and salsa should be complimentary. 

Anyhow I ordered the Fresh Snapper Tacos (see pics) 
There is a lot of fish there being smothered by all those peppers, but as for everything else what you see is what you get.

For $15 I would have liked more than a TBSP of each, rice and beans, and a DEFINITELY more than a teaspoon of cheese and sour cream and maybe a lime or lemon. 
There was more garnish on the plate than anything. Other than that it was good. 

My Friend ordered the Green Chile Stew and The Green Chile Mac and Cheese (see pics) She has been here before so knew what she liked. I tasted the macaroni and thought it was pretty good too.

I'll give 3 stars until I go back and try out some other things.",neutral,en
4,"My niece and I were having that conversation...where do you want to eat...I don't know where do you want to eat when we drove past the Rocket Burger corner.  I turned around to try it because of good Yelp reviews and my curiosity regarding the variety of Soda Pop.  We both got a large hot pastrami sandwich and soda pop.  The price was reasonable, the food was good and the soda pop made it a nostalgic experience.  I brought home half of my sandwich.  Just reheated it in the microwave and enjoyed it again.  I'll return to try the french dip sandwich on the menu.  P.S.  The meat and secret sauce gave the sandwich a great bite.  It blows away the 'roast beef' sandwich I had last week at Subway that looked like reconstituted meat.",positive,en
2,"I used to be a huge fan of this place, but it was just ok this time around..

A bunch of us went and I ordered their steak for two.. 22oz. Thought it might be good.  It was dry and had no flavor.  She had asked at the beginning ""Do you guys want A-1?""  I said ""No thanks.""  A good steak shouldn't need any sauce.  I should have asked for a ton of it.. just ugg..

We also got their artichoke, which was actually not too bad.  I love the one they do at Cheesecake  Factory. if you combine both, you have the ultimate smoked artichoke.  

Everyone was ok with their meal and one of my friends loved his.  He got the chicken fried steak.  Cant really mess that up I guess.  it was pretty good.

4,"My boyfriend and I came here this past Friday night for dinner as we had both drive by the place quite often and have been wanting to try it out. 

The service was great and I liked the wide open space. We tried two different beer samples for a $1 each and settled on splitting a pitcher of Levitation which we both enjoyed.

We ordered the green chile dip appetizer. I ordered the shrimp tacos and my boyfriend ordered the brisket. He LOVED the brisket and after taking a bite of it, I could see why. It was quite good. My shrimp tacos however, were so bland that I barely ate half of my meal. And it was a ""small plate."" I wasn't the biggest fan of our appetizer but after tasting my dinner, I decided I liked the dip a lot more and finished it off. Definitely do not recommend the shrimp tacos.

One annoying thing was our meals came out right after our appetizer. A little time in between would have been good - but I'll take that over slow service any day. 

I'm giving this place four stars because of how great the brisket was and despite not liking my dish, I had a great time and think this place has lots of potential. I'll be back to try something else!",positive,en
2,"I don't usually review based on one visit.  But when the experience and food is as bad as this, I'll make an exception...

This place gets two stars for the multiple big screen TVs.  If you're here strictly to watch sports and have a beer or three,  you'll be fairly happy.  However, I came here for a bite to eat, and that's when there where I ran into problems.

The bartenders are a disgruntled lot.  Their sour mood when I sat down set the tone for my whole experience here.  They're not all bad.  One of the male bartenders actually smiled occasionally and chatted with some of  the customers.

The food.  How can you screw up cole slaw?  What more can I say?

Good ambiance - I really thought it looked much like a few pubs I visited in Dublin (tho no pictures, that I saw, of the famous revolutionaries, no flags, no old photographs.  But a good draft beer selection.  And a really good Irish menu - we had the fish sandwich and the banger sandwich (lunch menu) which included chips (french fries) and I ordered a side of curry dip for the chips.  Good stuff.
Good Irish music (cd's) playing in the background - not obtrusive.  And a very good wait staff.  The bartender greeted us the minute we walked in. But sorry, folks, music is Thurs thru Sat and no Irish music that they admitted to - cover bands instead.  So I'll keep looking, but I'll stop here when I'm in the neighborhood.",positive,en

the service is a little hit or miss but they always keep your coffee cup full-you will almost always have to ask for extra milk-but whatever.

Love having the breakfast sandwich or their pancakes-my favorite ones are no longer on the menu though :( they had apples, sour cream and honey over them SO GOOD!

Not a place for breakfast cocktails though, so don't anticipate a good bloody mary.   their sandwiches are amazing, I've had several and have never been disappointed. 

Despite the shoty service it's a great spot for breakfast or lunch so definitely give it a try.",positive,en

It was pretty unorganized though and I am sure that it is due to people moving books to where they shouldn't be and there just being too many books to keep organized.

The Genius Bar is fun and very helpful when things go wrong; like when my new phone duplicating one calendar entry 341 times.  I had to bring in my Win-Tel PC into the Genius Bar and in the end we had to delete MobileMe to fix it.   But, absolutely great, GREAT customer service!!!

When we lived right across the street from the Sushi Brokers, J and I used to go there at least once a month for its happy hour. We probably had been there at least 8 times with friends and family.

5,"I took a cooking class with Chef Eddie Matney (Eddie's House Restaurant) and his recipe called for Vanilla bean olive oil from the Olive Mill. First off, what he made with this recipe was phenomenal much thanks to that smooth vanilla olive oil in there! I decided to google this place only to find out that Chef Beau Macmillan acclaimed a the kalamata sandwich from there as his ""bad boy favorite."" I don't know what a bad boy favorite even means but it has to be good especially since I've had his food and was quite impressed. 

I decided to make the 45 minute drive from Scottsdale out there on a Sunday afternoon to get my olive oil and try this kalamata sandwich. Such a cool atmosphere inside. It's like a trader joes/gift shop/paradise bakery all with a rural, kinda on the farm feel. You could easily kill an hour here just looking around at all the stuff for sale.  

I couldn't believe the kalamata sandwich! If you go there and order anything else....you're wrong. Freshest ingregients I've ever tasted. I feel like the pork could have just been butchered 5 minutes prior to me ordering it and the vegetables just picked from their garden (which they do have there). 

Pretty cool how you can sample the endless flavors of olive oil there. Got myself the vanilla bean and the blood orange as well. Make for some unstoppable pancakes. 

Tried the gellato and wasn't all that impressed. But in all due fairness, I'm not exactly sure what real gellato is supposed to taste like since all I've had is gelleto spot and grateful spoon.

Definitely worth the drive! Great place to bring the family.",positive,en

Cute Cupcakes and the place definitely has character!

I ate a coconut cupcake with sprinkled coconut and glitter on top. I only bought one cupcake and took it hope to share with my 3 roommates. It made me wish I had more cupcakes to share with the rest of them! We took our forks and gulped it down. 

The pink frosting was delicious and melted right in our mouth. The cupcake itself was very rich and moist. They must have substituted milk for the water while baking it, I could tell, so moist and mouth watering.

4,"I am not happy with the co worker who introduced me to Forefathers.  Do I really need another way to feed my addiction to cheesy, beefy goodness?  

Of course I do!

This small restaurant in a Tempe strip mall has earned a special place in my heart.  No, not just because of the artery-strengthening cheese.  It is home to the best cheesesteak I have experienced since moving to AZ.

While the menu offers a variety of choices other than cheesesteak sandwiches (chicken and even *gasp!* salads), I stick with what I know and love:

Regular with Cheez Wiz ($7.35) - bring your appetite, because this sandwich is big!  A generous portion of thinly sliced meat and that oh so important Cheez Wiz is nestled within a soft bun.  It is gooey, drippy and messy.  Perfect.  If Wiz is not for you, it is also offered with white American cheese, Provolone or Mozzarella.  While I prefer mine with just the basic meat and cheese, you healthy types can also get any combination of 'OMG' - onions, mushrooms and green peppers.

Fries are a very nice compliment to the sandwich.  Let's be honest here, fries are a very nice compliment to nearly anything.  Forefathers' fries ($2.55) are hot, salty and crisp.  If you haven't gotten your fill of Wiz on your sandwich, you can turn those fries into Cheese Fries ($2.95).  Either way, be sure to grab a container of 'fry sauce' (I am guessing this is some blend of ketchup and mayo).  One taste and you will want to put this on everything.  

Lucky for me and my cholesterol level, this gem is nowhere near where I live.",positive,en
3,"I just don't think I'm much of a brewery gal. Granted, the beer here blows Four Peaks out of the water, but I'd much rather have a nice cocktail than chew though a specialty brew. But if beer is your poison of choice, they've got just about everything. The happy hour is kind of weak here though, with like a buck off all drafts. Thoroughly meh.

You can peruse the coolers and grab a cold one or choose from 20+ drafts they have on the menu. No Bud Light here though. Sorry frat chumps. They used to have a ton of wine here as well (like, ages ago) but it has since been narrowed down to just four choices, none of which were calling my name this last go round. Their Orange Blossom wheat beer was a bit like drinking an orange creamsicle in beer form. Almost like a cider with floral notes, a light finish and a super creamy mouthfeel. (Oh yeah, bitches. I just went there.) The perfect beer for the novice drinker to enjoy. Their IPA was also pretty decent, but was more bitter than I care for, although it stayed far away from feeling like I was drinking a bottle of grassy perfume. Solid.

I thought they had deals on happy hour food (again, like a buck off) but last time I went it was no dice. At least the food's reasonably priced. Tasty rueben, craptastic hummus, crispy quesadilla. 

The acoustics in this place are kind of shitty, so go on an off time when it won't be packed, or run the risk of smiling and nodding amicably while hearing every other snippet of convo. The high top tables are also really uncomfortable for shorties like me to sit at, but c'est la vie. My biggest peeve about this place is the gigando assy television against the wall. For a place this small, a big ass mofo tv is just  not the way to go.",neutral,en

For the most part it is.  The thing that I found awesome, was that it has a daycare center.  If a couple wants to go to a movie and it's not appropriate for the child or they just want to do something for the two of them, they can bring their little one to the day care center.  I can't believe all the parents, who bring their kids to adult movies.  It's unacceptable and of course selfish of the parents.  I hope other theaters catch on to this.

1,"Seriously?! With grocery stores like Fresh & Easy, Trader Joe's, and even Safeway around here, I wouldn't go to Whole Foods regularly, for ANYTHING, unless I was a bajillionaire. 1. It's wayyyy overpriced. I'm not sure if there's a Central Market around here as haven't seen one yet, but even that is better than this in terms of price! 

We got a few items here, specialty items in bulk foods, for example. The wine and beer bar is cool, but unlike the Whole Foods in Austin, Tx, which was the epitome of awesome, (2) one can't walk around with beverage in hand here. Too bad the rules are so stringent about that, because if I were shopping with a glass of wine, maybe I wouldn't notice the horrendous prices quite so much.

My 3rd complaint is that when we ordered coffees from the coffee stand there, my mocha and my boyfriend's latte tasted like motor oil, after taking forever to be made, and the girl saw me swipe my card but THEN told me she ""didn't have a register person"" and I wasn't able to cancel the transaction....so then we had to go back through the main grocery line again. Grrr.  I left unsatisfied, uncaffeinated, and feeling like I had just wasted ten bucks on coffee that we ended up pouring out. 

They get one star for having a wine/beer bar at all, but then I have to take that star away because the bar tender said they sold the most beer and wine of any Whole Foods in existence (I call bs - the one in Austin is twelve times busier and people can shop with their beverage of choice, and they have a bunch of restaurants there too so it's truly an experience - it dazzles). This leaves one star for the supply of bulk and specialty items they carry. We went to Trader Joe's after, got twice as much stuff, and spent half as much money. Sayin'.",negative,en

First off, I think every time I've walked in the door I was greeted with two things - a bouncer checking IDs and a nice strong whiff of beer. Hello, if you didn't already know it... you're in a bar.

The place is kind of broken in to 3 parts - a bar, a restaurant, and a game room (billiards, ping-pong, darts, video games, air hockey, shuffleboard, etc.). I've played them all and I've enjoyed all the games. This is a pretty good place to just mess around with friends and BS and quite honestly this kind of reminds me of bars in Ohio where I'm from, albeit a bit more upscale since there is more. There is a lot of pool tables, so I would say that if you did have to wait, you wouldn't have to wait long. There is at least 4 tables.

I don't remember my bill total, but generally I get here and just play games or only have one drink. So I can't really even comment on the pricing.",positive,en
4,"I'm not normally a big fan of Italian food, but after marching six miles against 1070 in the Memorial Day weekend heat, I decided it was time to slang my Groupon on the table and carb it up.  And, fortunately, this was my favorite Groupon find yet.

Aiello's is in a beautiful building.  I don't think a building has ever detracted from my eating experience, but in case's like Aiello's, the wonderful shaded, verdant patio set the mood in all the right ways.

The inside is low-key family restaurant with a dash of romance.  Nice lighting, not too loud, cool bar.

The food was awesome.  Delicious, probably house-made pasta with simple flavors that let the sauces and vegetables sing.  An exhaustive - but not daunting - wine list - though it'd be nice to see more options served by-the-glass.

As icing on the cake, at the end of the meal, you get to play a game that might let you get your meal for free.  I won't ruin the surprise, but it adds a lot of character.

If I had an Italian grandmother, this is the sort of food I'd expect she'd make.  Highly recommended for a date night, classic dinner-and-a-movie style, for unpretentious delicious fare.",positive,en

They have everything here for cats, dogs, small birds, rabbits, poultry, horses and more! The customer service was excellent, we were even given free samples for our chickens without even asking and were given informational sheets about some awesome products we ended up buying as well. Both of the people working were concerned with taking their time to help us, not about making a sale, and will even special order some products for us if ever needed. We don't feed our dogs dry food anymore (they now eat raw instead), but when we did, these are the premium/healthiest brands we were buying at a much higher cost at other retailers.

The food is horribly boring and has no flavor. I ordered the chicken and avocado pizza and it literally tasted like nothing! We also got the nachos (which was actually just a plate of chips with one tiny pinch of cheese and soggy beef). In addition, the server didn't put in my order for my pizza, hardly apologized and then brought it to me 30 minutes after my friends were done eating. One of my friends ordered the ahi tuna and it was switched with someone else's special order so that had to go back to the kitchen and be reordered as well.

I ate the lamb shank- Angello Dorato, which fell off the bone and was delicious. I cleaned the plate. 

Dad had the veal marsala with fettuccine alfredo.  The veal was fantastic and the alfredo was just right. The sauce was not too thick-not to thin.  Dad cleaned the plate.  From him being in the food industry for 30+years and eating in many italian establishments both here and Chicago, believe me that says more than alot.   

Mom had the special of the night, which was a cioppino with tons of seafood.  When most italian restaurants serve this dish at least one of the seafood items will be rubbery or fishy tasting (not in a good way) especially the mussels.  Not here. Everything was the way it should be. I felt this was the plate of the evening out of 3 great dishes.   Mom didn't clean the plate, she has a small stomach.  But I will be eating the leftovers in about two hours after I sleep off my meal.

Everything from the bread, the calamari fritti, to the tiramisu was fabulous.  I'm glad we couldn't get reservations anywhere else for this special meal.

4,"Boyfriend and I went to try Lobby's after seeing the phenomenal reviews.  He got the famous Italian beef sandwich hot with cheese and I got the little veggie sandwich and an order of the chili cheese fries. He got his in a combo that came with a side of fries and a drink. The owner was there and took our order and he was suuuuuuuper nice.  He was really excited for new people to try his food.  

We went and grabbed a table and just as we sat down, a rush of people came in.  There must be a lot of regulars because he was greeting some by name. There must be something to this food for that many loyal customers. 

Not too long after we got our drinks, the food was ready. I decided to immediately dive into the chili cheese fries. The cheese was like the melty nacho kind (not spicy though) and the chili was actually kind of sweet. I wasn't the biggest fan of the chili. My boyfriend did like it and he doesn't usually like chili. I'd probably just get cheese or plain fries next time.  The little veggie sandwich was so tasty! It was lettuce, tomato and pickles (I didn't want onions) with their house sauce on a sesame seed bun.  I'd love to try a burger next time.

The boyfriend did like his sandwich except he didn't know it was going to be ""dipped"".  He doesn't like his sandwiches dipped, so if he were to get that again, he would request it dry.  The sandwich was hearty (I added a pic) and very filling. He kept stealing my chili cheese fries so I take it he liked those too. 

It was really bright and clean in there and the owner and the guy making the food were really cool.  I'd definitely come back. We both want to try the burgers next time. Although....the hot dog with all the stuff does look damn tasty too....",positive,en

2,"I have read several raving reviews of this place.  I was disappointed the first time so I went back again thinking I had an off experience.  I was still disappointed.  I had the carne torta the first time and the cubana the second.  The food was okay.  Not bad but not filling and not as good as some other places I can name off the top of my head.  The first time the torta came with chips and the 2nd time they came alone.  For 6 or 7 bucks Id expect a little more.  Here are a few places with much better tortas: Los Reyes De La Torta (7th st & Hatcher), El Gallo Blanco (Central & Indian), and El Nopalito (24th st and Thomas).",negative,en
5,"I think Mr Goodcents has the best subs in town.  I have no idea why people go to Subway.  Goodcents slices the meat and cheese when you order your sandwich and their bread is baked fresh - you can't beat it.  Get oil and vinegar on your sandwich and the taste is to die for.  

The staff was very friendly and oftentimes the owners are there working.  $5 footlongs are there too - only they taste 20x's better!  They're all over the city if this one isn't in your neck of the woods.",positive,en
5,"I personally like this Fry's. I think most of the people that work there are extremely friendly. I go there once or twice a week and I'm always greeted with a smile. A few of them even ask me where I've been if I haven't been in for awhile and ask me how I'm doing. Complaing about a grocery store being crowded doesn't make sense to me since that means people like shopping there. They have no control of it being crowded. If you don't like it crowded, go across the street to Safeway where there is no one shopping there. Then you will see a difference of why Fry's is better. Why is it so busy? Because it has better deals and everyone wants to shop there. It's a positive thing. You can either deal with it being crowded once in awhile and save money or go to Safeway across the street where you will be the only shopper and get ripped off. You have options.",positive,en
5,"I've never been to this location before. My husband had taken his car here previously, and asked me to take it in today (there was a nail a front tire). The second I stepped through the doorway I was greeted, even though all agents were busy helping other customers -- excellent customer service to acknowledge I'm there! 

Less than a minute later I had a gentleman walk me out to the car and look at it. He tested to see how far in the nail was, and realized it didn't puncture, so he took it out and said the tire was fine. 

I went there knowing my husband is WAY overdue for new tires, so asked for a quote. He gave me a few options, and told me what driving habits they'd be best for. He also gave me the warranty information without me asking for it, and included it in the price instead of ""shockingly"" adding it in when I would pay like most places would. I never thought for a second that I was being oversold. It was amazing because I despise going anywhere having to do with fixing my car. 

Quick. Clean. Friendly. Intelligent. Honest. That about sums up this place. I'd recommend it to ANYONE and tell you to go out of your way to visit this location.",positive,en
4,"After moving here a few months ago the search has been on to find a decent sushi place in Phoenix, after all, it's Phoenix.  I don't set my expectation too high because I know how difficult it can be to get fresh sushi here.  
I enjoyed Moira because their creations are simple and they don't drown the sushi in sauce like some other American sushi joints.  Sushi is about the rice and the fish.  Both were pretty good here.  The salmon and the white tuna nigiri were fresh tasting and soft and the rice was great as well.  The kamikaze roll was also delicious, but maybe could have used a little more spice.
They have the best miso soup I have had since living in Japan.  Very tasty, not watered down or flavorless like most other places.
The drinks creations are fun and tasty, I went for the favorite karma.  I like my drinks like a like my women, spicy, sweet, and filled with booze.  Our waitress said she would even be open for a new creation if we gave her some ideas.
The service was great and friendly.  We were there on a Friday, but surprised it wasn't loud and bustling.  I can see how it could be at times as it is a little small.  Fun and modern decor, clean place!",positive,en

Instead of calling a locksmith, the car washers tried and tried to get in through the window. Thankfully my husband was able to leave work early, go retrieve the kids from choir practice, and then come rescue me at the car wash with a spare set of keys. I was trapped there over an hour!

4,"Headed downtown to the soon-to-be-new-office with the boss today and had lunch here - he's lived in Phx for decades and recommended this place (although he hadn't been there in many years). I got a Super Sicilian. Absolutely delicious - the sesame bread looked like it would be hard/crunchy but it was soft and tasty. If I had to offer up any criticisms it would be 1) the fact that it inexplicably took something like 10 mins to make our sandwich - it just looked like it had been toasted, nothing else I could think of should have made it take that long, and 2) the sandwich was too small *8-) My mistake, of course. I got a whole, and could easily have downed two of those. Taste wise it's equivalent IMO to the ""all-American grinder"" at Uncle Sam's, except with the latter you can also get jalapenos. Will definitely return here once our office shifts downtown, but next time I'll get a sub and a half, methinks!

4,"Really great burgers...I would hope so with a name like Smashburger. This location is really good, so it gets busy at lunch time. Waiting is a bit of a pain, but it's typically not too long. The food takes a few minutes too, which is a positive in my book. The food here feels a lot fresher and better than fast food, though if you've seen their burgers, it's not a place that's super healthy.

They also offer chicken sandwiches (crispy or grilled), and salads, so there are some healthier options, but the winners here are the burgers and fries. Definitely try the smash fries. Tossed in olive oil, garlic and rosemary, they are delicious. Burgers are really good and juicy, and the ingredients they use seem fresh.

Cons are the long lines, and it's also not a place where you'll be in and out in 15 minutes. It's also not inexpensive. A burger, fries and a drink will run you $10-11, which seems high for ""fast food"", though I think it's worth it. What's nice though, is that you sit down with your number and they bring you your food, and they'll bus your table, so it feels like a combo of fast and full service...I suppose this is a perfect example of ""fast casual"". 

It's pretty close to my office, so I'll be back often. Definitely worth a try if you're in the area and craving a burger.",positive,en

Positive notes:  Hot sauce had some bite to it, chips were good, Camarones culichi had a wonderful sauce.  Lots of fresh limes served with the meal.  Full bar.

Not-so-positive notes:  Shrimp in the Camarones culichi was overcooked (cardinal sin for a seafood place).  The shrimp coctail was just ok - good sized boiled shrimp, but not too much flavor.  

If driving by and hungry I would stop in again, but not if I have to drive too far out of the way.",neutral,en
1,"Brought a group to Metro for brunch, made the reservation a month ago, called three days ago to update and ask to be outside and people arrived and were told there was no reservation. Finally spoke with the manager and had that sorted out but when I asked for our tables outside and they couldn't accommodate. 

Having the bartender wait on a party of 18 was idiotic. Not enough menus, slow, horrible drinks, no silverware, soup was burnt-how do you burn soup??? Attempting to fix the situation with beignets was a nice attempt until we heard the server swearing about having to deal with us. 

I host events all over the valley and never have I experienced service as horrible as I did at Metro. 

They have recently changed management, unfortunately the great reviews I read when I made the reservation don't hold true anymore.

Update 11/8/2010
Since my first review I received a $50 gift certificate from the management of Metro.  I decided to go for dessert last Friday night with 5 of my friends.  I knew I couldn't just go with one other person, it had to be a group to show what they could do.  

We arrived at 9:15 and were seated on the patio.  I met the general manager and she was pleasant enough, I never saw her again.  There was no one seated inside and the patio was half full.

Jesse greeted us and was the most attentive and understanding server when two guests needed to return their drinks to the bar because they were not made properly - it was a specialty drink from their cocktail menu.

We ordered beignets, apple bread pudding and triple chocolate delight.  The beignets and apple bread pudding were good.  The triple chocolate delight had absolutely no chocolate flavor at all.

Jesse was by far an excellent server and if you go ask to be seated in his section.",negative,en
3,"I was disappointed too.  I waited an hour and then took at seat at the counter which is ok with me, but if you've got long legs your only option is to sit spread-eagled in order to get close enough to your plate and there's not that much legroom to each side.  In the small space in front of the counter the staff was in perpetual motion squeezing past each other to get drinks, etc.   My cheddar, jalepeno, sausage omelette was very good, but not huge, and the hash browns were crisp and tasty on the outside but soggy on the inside.  The whole wheat toast was great, but no choice of toppings...I was given a small dollop of peach preserves.

4,"Gils.. A relatively new business to the complex on 16th St and Bell Rd. 

Gils is NOT your average Mexican Style food. It is New Mexican Style. They use whole beans, no lard and light on flavor. The rice is not orange but more of a yellow with hints of garlic infused. The burritos are covered in red or green sauce, which can be a hot or mild depending on the crop. 

I had the pork Carnita's burrito topped with green sauce. Beans and rice. I would have been disappointed it I expected smashed refried beans too. BUT I love the beans as they are. They are sort of like a ham hock style bean. The carnitas was wonderful and huge. filled with pork and not a spec of fat in it. Topped with cheese and Hatch Green Chilie sauce. Did I mention Huge? 

The whole meal including water and chips and salsa set me back $10 bucks. I even have a small lunch for tomorrow. The chips are homemade and the thicker type. The red salsa was spicy but not hot and green was good.

Our waiter, Jeff, was friendly and attentive, even lending us his flashlight to read an old newspaper story in the rafters. The cream of mushroom soup made from scratch was superb.

4,"I am a fan of big and tasty sandwiches but have had very few really good ones as of late. That is until I tried this place. I was in the area and decided to give the them a try after spotting their sign. When I first walked in I noticed the place was empty (normally a bad sign) but it was a Thursday afternoon so no big. This was my first time eating here so I took a few minutes to see what they had to offer. The sandwiches here come in different sizes from a small 5 inch to a 2 foot extra long, which makes it easy to decide what to order depending how hungry you are.

The 8 inch sub is easily enough for one really hungry person or two not so hungry people. Seriously it is about the size of a subway foot long and taste way better to! You have three choices when it comes to bread. They are white, wheat, and sourdough. I chose sourdough for my sandwich and it was chewy and seemed to be really fresh. Like most sub shops they also have a selection of pre selected combos (18 to be exact) with toppings like Ham, Turkey, Pastrami, Salami, Capicolla, Roast Beef, and Tuna. The cheese selection includes Provolone, Swiss, Smokey Cheddar & American

What makes this place so different from most sandwich joints is the fact that they hand slice your meat when you order it. No more slimy meat that has been sitting in a case for hours and floating in weird juices Yuck! Finally a place that understands that it is OK to take the time to slice meat for each customer because it makes for a better tasting sandwich. One that a customer will want to come back for over and over again

For me this place set the bar so high most of the other chain places will never be able to compare with the quality of not only the food but the great customer service that I received from this place. It is not often that a place is able to make such a great impression on me (read my other reviews) but I will definitely make sure to give them my business the next time I am in the mood for a sandwich. The only thing that brought their score down was the fact that they had no customer parking and I had to pay to park in the garage. Yes I understand it is Tempe but why not at least offer to validate my parking LOL.",positive,en

3,"3 stars is being generous.

Went to Tesoro tonight with my husband and two teenagers based on the glowing yelp reviews.  It is a very small restaurant, 9 - 10 tables with a small waiting area out in front, facing the strip mall parking lot.  We had a reservation for 7:30.  Arrived on time and were apologetically told that our table was not yet ready.   Had to wait out front for 20 minutes shivering.

After we were seated, drink, wine, and appetizer orders taken, we relaxed and began to settle in.  Problem was, it is a very loud room. Conversation was a challenge.  Looking around, we realized that we were the youngest table in the room.  Average age appeared to be 60+ years old. Oh, well, young and hip it is not.  Hopefully the food is good. Bruschetta and antipasto were tasty.  For entrees, we ordered the homemade Fettuccine Bolognese, Spaghetti al Pomodoro, the Chicken Saltimbocca and a special, Farfalle with shrimp and asparagus.  Flavors were good, not great, but none of the pasta was homemade.  Very much a disappointment.

On the upside, service was very attentive and friendly.  Unfortunately, food is only mediocre, and the strip mall location is a definite detraction in size and ambiance.  Would I return again?  No.",neutral,en
4,"this is my favorite music venue in phoenix. it is a smaller venue best for local or indie bands, but every show i've been to their has been far more memorable then any show i've been to in phoenix.

the place itself isn't too stunning, it is just a rectangular brick building with a bar area on the right when you walk in, booths on the left side of the wall, some high tables in the middle, a stage and standing area at the back, and an eclectic mix of art on the walls. however, the place has a really good feel to it and excellent sound that leads to really wild and memorable concerts.

the two that i remember the most were the presets/the rapture and spinto band/art brut/we are scientists. i thought the presets were pretty lousy until i saw them play there and the rapture played an absolutely amazing set that lasted almost 2 hours and inspired an epic, comfortably out-of control dance party. the other show was equally long and boisterous, highlighted by eddie argos coming out into the crowd to sing 3 songs.

the bad things about the place are that last time i went there was still no alcohol because they lost their liquor license. however, i heard that they have got it back now, but i'm not sure. the shows i went to i had to go down the street between sets and drink at alice cooperstown which isn't cheap. 

it also doesn't have a patio at all where you can hang out and hear the music or what is going on inside and drink or smoke. the venue reminds me alot of the lounge in the back of Plush in tucson except for the lack of a patio which is really important in a state like AZ where the weather is so good at night most of the year.

of course the worst thing is just the lack of bands that go there. most bands come to either marquee (heaven help us poor phoenicians) or even worse, the clubhouse. if you happen to be a tour manager reading reviews on yelp, please book your band at the brickhouse.

Update - 8/31 - Had to downgrade to 4 stars after my most recent visit. Its hard to believe that I'm downgrading them now that they have liquor available, but it's happening. 

They normally have local draft brews at this place for 2 dollars, but apparently when they have a show they don't sell it at all. Only bottles for 3 or 4 dollars. What's worse is that every bottle I ordered wasn't cold, tasted like they just threw it in the ice bin 30 minutes before. AND they kept running out of beers. What's even worse is that the mixed drinks run 6 DOLLARS for a really tiny glass. This place needs to get its act together. I'll be drinking beforehand and elsewhere in between sets from now on. I don't get why the music venues in Phoenix don't understand how much more money they can make at a show with drink specials.

They also apparently haven't invested in air conditioning which makes summer shows not even worth it. Okkervil River still put on a great show to my surprise, which is the only thing (along with the other great shows i've seen there) that kept me downgrading this place to 3 stars or lower.

They are also in the middle of remodeling so the place looks kindof like crap right now.",positive,en
2,"We went here for the fabulous UYE. As the restaurant is often empty, Julia though it would be good to give them some business...but in the end it was our group that ended up being given the business. The words highway robbery come to mind, but I guess we weren't really on the highway. The prices listed on the menu really didn't seem that out of line, a bit on the pricey side but nothing alarming. Our waitress slyly sold us a kazillion dollars worth of appetizers that were not on the menu. We got 4 plates which consisted of 4 individual sauces with some stuff in them...one had shrimp, one had chicken, one had pork, and one had chihuahua. Oh wait, I think that was the cheese on top. Anyway, the plate with 4 tablespoons of sauce was not worth the $25...oh wait, we got 4 of them. The waitress also managed to slip two orders of guacamole in on us for $11 a piece. As far as the entrees are concerned, the portions were small and the food was kind of meh. The mole was way too sweet for my taste. The biggest bummer of all was NO BOOZE! The $120 worth of appetizers would have gone over much better if they were washed down with some frosty margaritas. A couple of pitchers and they could have slipped us some $100 flan.

Regardless of the price and the mediocre food, it was well worth going for the amazing company of the awesome Phoenix Yelpers. I don't think I would go back for the food though.",negative,en

3,"I had a hard time even giving this place the third star.  I had high hopes as I watched this place go through renovations during the past 3 years.  We were there on opening night and fell in love with the decor.  The place was stylish and cool.  Concrete, leather, glass...very retro-modern.  The people who refurbished and redesigned this place deserve five stars.

The people who work there, however, deserve one.  

On opening night, I forgave the delay in service.  I forgave the nasty arugula on my panino.  I forgave the store-bought peperoni.  Mostly, I forgave them because the onion straws were so good.

We went back a few nights later after being fleeced for $40 in return for table scraps at Sens.  It took almost twenty minutes to order two pizzas and onion straws.  Then, the pizzas came out before the onion straws.  How do you cook pizza faster than deep frying an onion?  The waiter lingered around the female members of our party and were just incompetent.  

We finally went again after a night of drinking at the Clarendon.  What a buzz kill.  Not only was it too dark and the music was too loud but, again, the service was slow and dull.  Then, the waitress got into an argument about the ingredients of the pizza with our group.  Big no-no.

I've had multiple people tell me that service is fine as long as you order from the bar.  They say, just get up and go tell the bar tender what you want.  Why should I have to do all of the work?  How is it that they have ASU students at their disposal in a terrible economy and can't hire any decent waiters?

From now on, I'm only going after a game when I want some onions and a Moretti.",neutral,en
5,"This is my kind of restaurant. I love everything about Buca di Beppo!

I am fascinated by how this place was decorated. All the walls and various trinkets make this a fun dining experience. 

One thing to note is that it can be kind of expensive to eat here, although I am always finding coupons for this restaurant so that helps!

Beyond that the food is awesome! I go with my fiance and we love the calamari and the garlic bread, which we always get as appetizers. We switch up the main course when we go, but each time has had great results. We had dessert here once too and that was also good! We usually end up with leftovers, because they give huge portions, which we love. I can't wait to come again!",positive,en

Good:
Very comfortable bed
Clean
Funky/cool decor which is unique
Very friendly and helpful staff
Fair price
Great location

Not so good:
Pricey overnight parking that was a surprise upon check in
No coffee maker in room; this is pretty well standard for most hotels. We had to either go to the lobby for $4.50 per cup or drive off site. 
On our final morning before leaving (2 1/2 hours before checkout) with our do not disturb sign duly mounted on the outside of our door, we were disturbed by a rap-rap-rap-rap of who I assume was the cleaner. WTF!",neutral,en

4,"I've come here too many times to count during my time at ASU.  Each time I've frequented this place, I've pretty much inhaled whatever sandwich I got.  I like the fact that you can customize your sandwich to order and I really like the fact that you get a little chocolate chip cookie for free with your order!  (Their jumbo cookies are pretty darn good too!)  Avoid this place during the lunch rush, as the queue can literally snake outside and around the building.  Prices may seem on the high side for ""just"" a sandwich, but the ingredients are fresh and the people behind the counter are generally cool.

4,"While we were finishing up at Forefathers, I checked my mobile Yelp app to see what else was in the area.  Zoyo popped up and the reviews were good so I asked my daughter if she wanted dessert.  Silly me, of course she said yes! It was a short drive to Zoyo.  I passed it the first time cause my GPS said it was on my right but nooooo it was on the left.  We made a quick u-turn and there we were.  

It was clean and well lit and nicely laid out.  If I remember correctly there were either 10 or 12 different flavors.  I had Red Velvet and Banana.  YUM!  The Red Velvet was delish!  My daughter had RV and Cake Batter.  They had all the standard toppings and the topping area as well as the yougurt area was very clean.  The young people (oh god I sound old!) that were tending to the counter were pretty efficient and friendly.  There was pleanty of seating too.  Some nice larger, round tables and then what looked like a hallway had some smaller tables for two.  There were also tables outside.  It was a Saturday night and there seemed to be a steady stream of people coming in while we were there.  Some stayed, some got theirs to go.  They also had two flat screen tvs on the wall .  One was playing The Bee Movie and the other had Soccer.  Overall our experience here was a good one and we will be back.  I may even bump it up to 5 stars after I try more flavors.  Although if they always have Red Velvet......but then again it's good to try new things.  Thank you Zoyo!",positive,en

2,"I have to admit that I can't stop going to Carly's even though I KNOW I shouldn't!  

Good:  I can't get enough of the Cape Cod salad! It is really somethin' special, that ain't no lie.  Also the soup is always flavorful.

Bad: Has nothing to do with the food. It is all about the atmosphere, which is oppressive in an I'm-so-unique-and-talented-and-you-are-smelly-dung sort of way. Staff is pretentious and lazy. They think they must be pretty lofty individuals for working there but that doesn't mean they LIKE to work, for god's sake....  The owner. She is somewhat friendly, but beware. She is the person who created this environment, and it becomes easy to believe once she starts bragging about how well-off she is.  So congratulations everyone! We support these immature little weasels who scorn this gross human ritual we indulge ourselves in: being a customer, AND apparently we have made the owner a rich woman but shhhhhh! She's still the kewlest of the kewl.

UPDATE: Received an annoying email from the owner (the husband) who instructed me give "" *constructive criticism* "" and not make a personal attack or be petty. My review was neither of those things. I do not know John, nor do I know Carla. I only know what I experience when I have lunch at their place of business. The staff was rude and lazy. The owner DID brag. The food I always order is good. Get a grip buddy.

I was honest about my experience for OTHER PEOPLE who are considering spending their cash on food there.  I am not in the least concerned about the owners or the staff personally, but apparently John thinks I ought to be.  I ought to see how great Carla is. In fact, he goes into detail about how great Carla is.  It's nice to witness a man standing up for his lady. It would almost cause me to add a star up there, but sorry, no can do.  His improper use of the possessive apostrophe SEVERAL times canceled that out (okay, now that was petty -my bad).  

I'd advise John to concentrate on things other than trolling around yelp, chastising his own customers, whose business supports that fancy paint and the famously zombie-like staff.  Maybe the staff is just following John's lead when they don't focus on creating a positive experience for their customers?

Honestly, I remain puzzled as to why John would bother to bother me.  I go into a small restaurant to find the owner bragging. That is part of my experience and I will continue to post reviews featuring owners, and how they carry themselves.

As for the ""personal attack"" on Carla, I will not retract what I said just because John is butthurt and whines about it. I will say this: Carla has probably been in the restaurant several of the many times I have dined there, but I perceived the bragging only one time. I doubt anyone who read my review would label this person a braggart based on that one experience of mine, and as I said before- it did not and would not stop me from going back.

I will be back. I will order the food and enjoy the food, but since that's not the only part of the dining experience, I will tolerate the negative things because the food I regularly order is consistently good.",negative,en

My Jasmin iced tea never got to the bottom. The menu has great variety. The pad Thai was excellent as were the vegetarian rolls. The Tom Ka soup was excellent. Every member of our group got something different and they were all extremely happy. We will be back. Pricing was very reasonable. There is patio seating available. Check it out.",positive,en

I got to order 3 different things from here. The Java Chip blended coffee (possibly actually called a frappe) was.. good, but not $5 good. Starbucks offers better quality, and premade mix, for less. 

The second thing I ordered was a scoop of rose water gelato and a scoop of mango peach gelato during half price gelato. Much better. The gelato was smooth, rich, and very freshly flavored. 

Finally I had a feta cheese and spinach empanada. This was also very good, the feta being subtle and the empanada having ample amounts of spinach baked in a perfectly crusty bread.

Overall, good quality food, OK quality drink, decent value for your money.",positive,en

2,"I guess it's not really the most accessible place, but Frank & Albert's is located in the Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa and serves as one of their restaurants to their guests.  Since the other breakfast place they had was only a cafe that served baked goods, I decided to come here to have a proper breakfast.

When I asked what they recommended they immediately said ""the Biltmore Benedict"".  I was easily sold so I ordered one, and a coffee.

Cool thing about the coffee is they just bring you a carafe to serve yourself coffee as you please.  Not sure if this was because the waitress was lazy, but I thought it was nice.

The eggs benedict themselves were not the best.  On one hand the ham that they used was overcooked (ie. jerky).  On the other hand the english muffin was over toasted and too crispy, which kinda ruined the overall consistency.

It is a nice patio that they have to sit on, so I will give them that.  They apparently have a bird problem where birds kinda come and scavenge for food.  I didn't really mind it.",negative,en
4,"So, I avoided this place like the plague for the longest time.  No reason really, it just never caught my attention.  It always seemed to be empty, which led me to believe it must not be that great.  Well, don't judge a book until you walk in and try the spaghetti! 

The Bollo Neapolitan has been my favorite pasta so far and the steak sandwich is to die for.  I'm telling you- I never order steak sandwiches and I fell in love!   I've tried a few of the other pastas and they were ok, but the Bollo Neapolitan was my fav with the runner up being the Garlic Shrimp Pasta.

Now for the Negatives.  The chicken on the pasta just never really tastes right to me.  I don't know what it is, but it has a very gamey taste.  The dishes I've tried without chicken have been far superior in my view.  

Finally, I've never seen this place packed.  That can be a negative or a positive depending on my mood, but I would like to see a few more patrons.  So, if you don't want to wait in line at the other Italian joint in the AMC 30 complex (Macaroni Grill) or are looking for a non chain option, check out Neapolitan! The service has always been great too.

Bottom Line: I'm glad to finally have a decent Italian choice when going to the movies at AMC 30.",positive,en

Another nice touch was the manager personally coming over to introduce herself and ask about our experience.

4,"When one course of a meal is so significantly better than the rest of it, it's hard to write a balanced review.  I went down to Cheuvront with a few friends for Restaurant Week.  The place is tiny, very relaxed-hip looking, and right on Central Ave.  While the place doesn't have any distinct look or theme going on, there was a movie with french subtitles playing on a screen next to the dining area so...I guess it's supposed to be French.  They have wine and cheese too, so, yeah, probably French.

So the meal didn't start out so great.  The spinach salad came out to me on a dirty place.  Sure, it's a restaurant.  I know other people use the same plates and silverware I'm using, but things like that, especially when noticed, are off-putting.  Unfortunately, the ahi tuna that followed was also overdone.  Not in a bad way, and I almost didn't notice through the thick peppercorn crusting, but when it was pointed out, I was a little disappointed.

That was when they pulled out dessert.

I'm not a sweets person.  I don't know that I've ever been.  Give me spicy or savory 10 times out of 10 over any kind of sweet-tasting anything.  Although my dentist might argue evidence to the contrary, I really just don't have a sweet tooth.  That being said, I wanted to die and be entombed in the citrus flan that was put in front of me.  I wanted to lick the plate clean and then go back to the kitchen and demand they fill my pockets, one with the smooth, creamy, more-like-custard-than-flan flan and the other with the wonderfully sweet and subtle citrus sauce they coated the dish with.  I'd also probably ask for some of the figs and berries to be put in a doggie bag.

I have never, in my entire life, enjoyed a dessert as much as this one.  I would happily drive the 20-plus minutes downtown just to have this again.

Before I forget or the keyboard shorts out from me drooling, the wine selection here is also amazing.  I didn't take time to look at the whole thing, but I think most wine connoisseurs would be happy here.

While it was a mixed bag, the place certainly deserves another trip.  I can see (if I had a real life, not one that consisted solely of studying) sitting out on their patio, enjoying Phoenix, and making a dent in their wine and cheese stocks.",positive,en

4,"Love the Vig Uptown's vibe, decor and oh yeah, food!  The only thing that I tried that I thought was just ok, was the Pad Tia.

A friend of ours, a die hard foodie, Loved the pork chop with the polenta and cherry sauce... if we had looked away for a second I'm sure she would have licked the plate!!!
All in all, the only bad experience we had was the forced valet service.  Just drives me crazy that a restaurant uses the main parking lot for ""free"" valet, when it should be for customers, and valet down to another lot.  No such thing as free... then people sneak into lots down the way to save the tip.  If this was Chicago, or New York I could see it, but not Phoenix.  But don't let that keep you away...",positive,en
4,"I really expected crappy food, because, after all, that's what sports bars generally offer.  Then I was told that the food was not bad, but good!  Which only made me eye my table mates suspiciously.  I ordered the tacos al carbon which comes with cilantro lime rice.  these are three street taco sized dealies that have steak in them and come with a little shot of pico and queso.

Now like I said, I expected crap.  But the tacos, with pico and queso poured on them, and grease dribbling out into a glorious puddle on the plate, were really amazingly good.  The steak bits were really tender--ordinarily in such a taco they'd be the tenderness of jerky.  Really: the tacos were totally sensational.

Also, we ordered a buffalo chicken flatbread which is essentially a pizza.  And it was great!  even with the bleu cheese, which I detest, this was a culinary delight.

So why the four stars, you ask?  two reasons.  One: the cilantro lime rice is offensively bad, like straight out of a box of rice-a-roni bad.  I would have preferred kibbles and bits as a side item.

And one other thing: it was happy hour and for a while they were serving beer OUT OF PITCHERS THAT WERE IN THE REFRIGERATOR INSTEAD OF STRAIGHT OUT OF THE TAP!  Capital crime.  Felonious.  In fact, Dante wrote about a circle of hell where all they did was serve beer out of pitchers instead of straight from the tap.

So you should know that although the beer serving would usually be a four star deduction and I'd never look back, I didn't drink beer tonight and so I really don't care if my table mates suffer.  But if you try that shit on me...

Four stars.  The food is really damn good.",positive,en

By that time, we had decided our food order, and gave her that, too. Another 10 minutes later, we received our beverages. another 25 minutes later, we received our order, and my chili cheese fries were decidedly bland, while his hamburger was worse than McDonalds.

The bar is roomy and comfortable, with more than ample stools to accommodate my generous tush. Say hello to Shelley who is mi favorito bartender!  You are welcome to dine at the bar, but the dining room is much more comfortable, with a great deal of banquette seating-  which I adore.  I often have the veal chop, or a nice, big NY Strip.  Twice baked potatoes, creamed spinach......you know the routine in the ""good old boys' steakhouse.""  The best part is the house made chopped chicken livers which are simply to die for.

5,"It's 1961 and we're having lunch in the courtyard of our Miami Beach hotel. Parker House rolls, sweet and salty, an open-face meatloaf sandwich with mushroom gravy. There's a surf board and a tiki carving amidst the flowers. But wait - something's wrong!! There's no humidity! Those are imported mushrooms in my gravy! I work to orient myself in time and space and find, what a relief, that I'm actually in Cafe ZuZu in downtown Scottsdale and it's 2010.

 The Valley Ho Resort, which houses the Cafe, is such a wonderful period piece. It opened in 1956 and was renovated in 2005 by a very wise design team that left the mid-century architecture and spirit intact. Cafe ZuZu is at the far end of the lobby, and its charming patio is surrounded with flowers. The decor is late 50's. If you're as old as we are, you'll recognize it instantly. The menu consists of ""Flavorful American comfort food. Familiar favorites with a contemporary twist."" There are goodies like warm Maytag blue cheese fondue ($7.50), truffled grilled cheese ($9), beef stroganoff ($17), and (gross) tuna salad with cottage cheese which brings me back to my childhood a little too clearly.

 While waiting for our entrees, we received a basket of Parker House rolls. These are the nice squishy white bread treats that, if you can manage not to eat them all, make wonderful toys. You can mold them into sculptures, or shape them into little round beebees to shoot through your straw. My meatloaf sandwich ($11.25) was served on a thick piece of grilled white bread topped first with melty cheese, then the meatloaf, then the gravy. There was a mound of lumpless mashed potatoes alongside. They were so smooth Ken wondered if they were made from instant, but they tasted much too good for that. The portion was huge, I took half home (of course I knew I was going to have dessert). Ken had sauteed liver, beautifully prepared, atop a mound of kale that had been cooked with high quality bacon, sauced with a Madera reduction. He loved it. I surprised him by ordering a lemon meringue tart ($6) for us to share. There were several chocolate desserts that sounded good, but I had a vision of the mile high meringue toppings of my childhood. The tart had only modest swirls of meringue, but it had been made in such a way that it was creamy, as opposed to foamy, and it was really good.The lemon custard was the star. I remembered a gelatinous filling, but this was smooth and velvety, with just the right tart/sweet balance. The pastry was a cross between cookie and pie crust, and stood up well to the filling.

 This was not an inexpensive meal, but the portions are large and quality is excellent. Plus we had joined an organization called The Lunch Club, which every weekday, emails it's members a discount coupon for a restaurant in their specified zip code. So one of our entrees was free! (The discount coupons differ, some are 20% off the bill, others merely are for a free drink). But, to pay Cafe ZuZu the ultimate compliment - I'd come here and pay full price.",positive,en

3,"Yelpers prove to be right yet again with the average 3 stars on this one... 

I was craving sushi and had a hot date with my sister-in-law last night to do dinner and a movie... It just so happened that Eat Pray Love was playing at the Tempe Marketplace Harkins Theater, so we decided to meet at Kabuki before the movie.  

I walked in first and asked how long the wait was for two... I as told 10 or 15 minutes.  Not so bad... so I decided to wait.  I walked outside and met up with my Alexa and we came back in about ten minutes later... As we did so, two other women came in and I saw that they were seated right away.  I looked at Alexa, looked up at the hostess stand, was thinking (WTF), and then went and asked nicely where we were on the list.  

""There are two tables before you,"" I was told.  ""It will likely be another ten minutes or so."" 

At that, I responded, ""is there another option, perhaps sushi bar, that I don't know about?""

And alas, there sure was... (they neglected to give me that option when I originally checked-in).  We were seated at the sushi bar at that moment and went on to have a very underwhelming meal.  Here's why:

-While the large portion cucumber salads we ordered were extremely tasty, the cucumbers were cut lengthwise in such a way that it was difficult to eat.  I prefer cucumbers diced in smaller pieces so they are easier to eat!

-Service - our waiter wasn't the friendliest... I felt kind of rushed by him when we were there.  Additionally, since we were seated in the middle of the sushi bar, all of the wait staff would reach over us to pick up the sushi for their tables, which was very distracting while we were eating!  Perhaps they could've moved the sushi ready for pick-up to the side of the sushi bar to avoid distracting guests in the future?

-The sushi itself was good; not amazing.  We had a Sunset roll, a Lotus roll, a Large roll, and an order of Ikura.  I didn't realize the Lotus roll was going to have a ton of mayo along with the baked Lobster that came on top of it... it was a bit on the creamy side for my liking.

-To top things off, when the bill came, they overcharged us... a simple mistake, but given our experience, it was just one more negative thing... and then when I pointed it out, I barely got an apology at all.

With so many other restaurants to choose from in the Tempe Marketplace, I am not sure I'll return to Kabuki.  If I do, however, I will wait for a regular table!",neutral,en

I had trouble deciding what to order because everything looked so good! I split the Big Ass Burger (a huge ground chuck patty with cheddar cheese, peppered bacon, thick-cut tomatoes, pickles, and onions) and a kettle of fries with a couple friends. I also had the mixed greens salad (field greens with candied walnuts and feta, with some sort of vinegarette). The ahi tuna looked really good, as did the fish tacos.

The B√°nh x√®o was so greasy I couldn't eat it, it was literally served on a plate of grease. 

The bun was about the same. It lacked flavor, the rice noodles were slimy, the spring roll was loaded with grease. 

I ordered some sort of plum soda drink and it had a cup of salt on the bottom of the glass.

The service was horrible and I will not be back.",negative,en
5,"I love pueblo pediatric also!  And, also surprised there aren't any reviews!
There staff is always friendly and helpful. Rooms are always clean.
 I take my baby to Dr. Salek. He always answers all of our questions and never makes us feel ""stupid"" for asking. He also takes his time and even asks us how we are doing. Most physicians these days are in and out of the room before you can even feel like your questions are answered, but Dr. Salek really takes his time. 
I went in during a very busy day...flu season actually.  My baby had a fever and I called the office to fit me in. They did surprisingly and I saw Dr. Salek. He examined my baby and reassured me his fever is fighting off infection and not to worry.  Well as any mom, I was worried and continued with my questions...I was there for 30 min with him and not once did he make me feel rushed. I even thanked him for squeezing us in and he replied ""we would rather stay later to see all our sick patients than to send you to urgent care because we are overbooked"". 
Now that's what I call service...if only MY doctor would fit me in and not send me to urgent care!
I haven't seen the other physicians but am sure they are just as good! Also, they are a private practice from what I know so each physician owns part of the practice...meaning they take pride in what they do!",positive,en

The tofu dumplings were delicious. Satay chicken was alright. 

We had a choice between 3 entrees. I want to give them higher ratings for their service, but the spiciness between the dishes were very inconsistent. You get to choose on a 1-5 scale and finding a dish that suited your desired spiciness was a hit or miss. Some people's 1-2 were super spicy and other's 4-5 weren't that spicy. (note: 5 is spiciest) 

Also, we had a huge mess with the bill where they put all the appetizers onto one bill for a table, and none on ours. It was quite a mess trying to figure that out. Also, their timing for food was so bizarre. By the time 1 table had basically finished their dinner then the rest of the meals arrived.  Then again, dealing with 40+ people is a lot.",neutral,en

3,"My husband and I tried this place out since it is fairly close to our house and gets decent reviews.  I drank, my husband ate.  The wine selection is ok and the staff seemed friendly.  My husband's dinner was okay.  I'd probably give this place better reviews had they not attempted to give themselves a $15 bump on their tip.  I'd also probably give them better reviews if the manager would have called me back after leaving a message with a staff member about the charge especially when I left all the details necessary to fix the issue and was promised a call back that afternoon when the manager arrived.  Now, I can only assume it was not an inadvertent mistake since they give me no reason to believe otherwise.  I really would rather not have to keep calling back and chase my $$ down.

Edited review - took them from 1 star to 3 stars since I received a phone call today from a manager and was advised it was a mistake and they credited me back the funds.  Also will be sending me a gift card for the trouble.  Overall, I appreciate the follow up and their efforts to fix the issue and bring me back in.

4,"RnR strikes me as a casual, urban place to meet up for drinks and a bite to eat. It's not what comes to mind when I think old town Scottsdale, but places like this popping up are helping to change my mind about the area. Unfortunately after I was finished I was reminded that it's still old town when I walked by a pan flute band on Main St.

The old town parking corral is directly behind RnR, you can get to it from the alley next to RnR or off of 2nd Street.

The space has a refreshing, industrial feel. I was impressed by the thought put into the seating options. Inside mostly features traditional high top tables for four, but I noticed they had a table near the bar that could seat at least 12. The downstairs patio features another bar, and both table and lounge chair seating. The upstairs patio has the best date seating, lots of tables for two.

There was a lot of staff working during my visit. The host was friendly, and my waiter was attentive. My water was never empty and I got my sandwich in under 10 minutes. If anything they were a little too eager to please. I was both impressed and bemused when my waiter refilled my water glass, apparently noticed my ice had mostly melted, then returned with a scoop of ice to add to my cup.

I just got a grilled cheese (which includes tomato and bacon) on my visit, I had dinner plans later but I was interested in feeling this place out. I really enjoyed it. The bread is cut pretty thick, which made me a little nervous. But it had a wonderful texture, and after a few bites I decided it worked for me and didn't overpower the delicious sharp cheddar and bacon like I expected.

I look forward to returning to try other meals, and to sample what the bar has to offer. I understand RnR will have both late night hours and breakfast service. This is a great place to visit any time of day, but I'm excited about having a new, good place I can frequent after (or during) a night out.",positive,en

2,"My darling SO just looooooves this place, supposedly because they have a BLT that comes with avocado and a half-cooked egg on it. Ummm... OK. When he finally dragged me here, I realized he probably likes it because the waitresses hit on him. (Honeybuns, if you're reading this, they'll do anything for a tip. ANYthing...!?)

I got a veggie egg white omelet, which had all my favorite components of caramelized onions and broccolini, but it tasted as if they had sauteed the veggies in the drippings from the burgers that just came off the grill. Uh, gross. This alone takes the rating to two stars, and I'm not even a super-strict vegetarian. It's just disgusting. The English muffin was this weird little hockey puck that really served no purpose other than to serve as a vehicle for the tasty, homemade apricot preserves that came on the side. The chocolate cherry scones were delish and the coffee quite good.

The booth next to us held three 20-somethings (two dudes and a chick) downing mimosas, still wasted from the night before, who thought it fun to play their cell phones and/or iPods at high volumes. Just annoying as shit. Later, when I visited the swanky bathrooms, I saw the girl out crying in the lobby. Guess the swordfight didn't end well.

4,"Sometimes I think my love for Mongolian BBQ is TOO much. I could eat at places like Genghis Grill or YC's multiple times a week and never get sick of it. Hell, I won't go to chinese buffets if they don't offer Mongolian BBQ. It has to be one of my favorite foods. That is why when I moved to North Phoenix, it was a hard adjustment with there being none of the marquee Mongolian BBQ chains being up here. Then I found Stir Fry Paradise via Yelp.

My girlfriend and I went to Stir Fry Paradise on a Saturday after lunch hour. When we went in the manager(or owner, not sure) greeted us and made sure we had been to a Mongolian BBQ place before so we would know what to do. While we were selecting our food, she even made sure to help us with a sauce selection and let us know what combos work best. After that, she ended up cooking our food as well. She was really outgoing and helpful.

The food selection was pretty standard for a Mongolian BBQ place. Chicken, pork, beef, and turkey. You could pay extra for shrimp. They had a decent variety of veggies, but all I ever go for is pineapple. They offer three kinds of noodles for your meal and nine sauce varieties. In addition to the stir fry choices, they have a small sidebar of regular chinese buffet items. Normally when a place like this has this side offer, they are pretty bad and not edible. At Stir Fry Paradise, this is the opposite. My girlfriend and I both enjoyed a few items from the side bar. 

Overall, I would say check our Stir Fry Paradise if you're in the neighborhood and want some Mongolian BBQ. Good prices and great service make this a great local eatery.",positive,en

Here is what I liked:
*The food, appetizers, pasta dishes and warm bread (and the tomato/bruschetta like topping they give you with it).
*The fact the owner/chef is present and wants to ensure you enjoy your meal.  
*Good location, plenty of parking.  
*Value, prices are in line with what I would expect to pay for the quality and type of food you get.  

Here is what was just OK:
*Service, our server was nice enough but he got distracted chatting with other employees and customers and often forgot to check back with us to refill waters, remove dirty dishes, etc.  On the plus side, he knew the menu and made excellent recommendations.
*Atmosphere, I know they are doing the best with the building they have to work with but I felt a bit like I was in a remodeled pancake house trying to be an Italian restaurant.   The one exception would be the bar area which was more elegant/traditional.

Having lived in South Korea for two years, I can honestly admit that this is some of the most authentic Korean cuisine I've had in Phoenix. I typically ate bibimbap once a week minimum over there and I can't really tell the difference between Takamatsu's version and the stuff I had on the other side of the Pacific. I noticed they offer a list of other, more obscure foods I learned to love over there, including naengmyeon (cold, spicy noodles), japchae (stir-fried glass noodles), and several other dishes. They also follow tradition and bring you several side dishes. Love it or hate it, kimchi accompanies every meal, as do spicy bean sprouts, a tangy spinach dish and a few other random sides. It's a little bit more expensive than average restaurant prices in the Valley, but definitely worth it when you consider the sides that come with it, and a complimentary spiced tea for ""dessert.""",positive,en

* Pizzas slapped together resulting in uneven, soggy crusts. Our party ordered 5 of the 6 available.

* Psychological warfare of having to wait forever for just a few tables maintains an air of pompous superiority that tricks the famished patrons into reporting the pizza is a lot better than it really is. Waiter actually boasted about the 3 to 4 hour Saturday night wait, which we got around by having reservations!

* Bottles of iced tea and other drinks bought in bulk rather than any alternative that would make more sense.

Good? Not bad... Best in the Phoenix Valley? HIGHLY debatable, but personally I really can't say that I think so... Best is the USA? Impossible, there's just no way.

The place was devoid of the stereotypical Scottsdale element we prefer to avoid.  I found the prices easily justifiable in fact I though them quite reasonable.  We had the three onion tart appetizer, which was spectacular. For entrees we had salmon, filet, and a pair of lamb shanks.  Everything was wonderful.  The presentation was clean and the freshness and quality of the proteins, produce and accoutrement's was immediately evident.  Everything was cooked skillfully.  Had three of the four desserts on the menu.  The chocolate raspberry tart definitely stood out followed closely by the berry tart.  Delicately prepared and presented these were really an unexpected treat.  The environment is wonderful for Dining and chatting with people you actually like. The interior is intimate and it lends itself well to the cuisine.  I found the staff courteous, knowledgeable and professional.

4,"Impressive dinner tonight!  However, it was a packed house, and it took over an hour for my Panang Curry to arrive.  While I was a part of a large group of about 14, our particular group had 6 people.  One tablemate's entree (Ginger veggie stir-fry?) arrived at least 20 minutes before the second tablemate saw hers (Yellow Curry).  It was at least another ten minutes before the third tablemate saw his, and so on...  I was able to sample my neighbors' dishes of Spicy Catfish (battered and fried catfish topped w/ bell peppers, basil, and spicy red curry sauce) and Swimming Rama w/ pork (topped w/ peanut sauce over steamed veggies).  All three were AMAZING!  I'll definitely order the Rama and the catfish next time!!!

Didi, our server, moved quickly, was efficient, and attentive, and was even helpful in suggesting alternate selections to those who had never had Thai food before.  She even warned tablemate Ericka, who'd only recently discovered peanut butter as an entree ingredient, that she'd either love or hate the Rama.  We were thankful that she rolled the dice and ordered it, anyway.

I hope that the kitchen crew can work out the kinks as far as pacing goes-I hope that by next visit I can up the review back to five stars!!

4,"The new, old El Chorro Lodge has been reopened for all of two days, and a friend of a friend managed to secure a reservation during their soft opening, so I got an opportunity to check it out.  I was impressed, but not blown away.  Everything I tasted was quite competent, but if I had to choose a word to describe the menu, I would suggest ""staid.""  Perhaps even ""stodgy,"" but that may be more harsh than I intend.

Review the dinner menu.  http://bit.ly/aWqVVJ.  There, see what I mean?  Replete with Traditional American entrees and sides, at what I would consider fairly exorbitant prices.  I would say that I wouldn't go back to eat this food at these prices, unless someone else was paying.  

I should note that a big part of why I wasn't impressed is because this place is simply not my style.  The wait staff, attired in khakis and blue shirts, was a little too informal for the prices we were paying, I felt.  The menu options were a little boring for my taste.  The cocktail menu is exactly not what I'm looking for these days, although I will be very interested to see what Happy Hour looks like.  The decor is a tad heavy on the Old Southwest theme, although to be fair, this place not only pulls it off rather stylishly but also is among the most authentically old and southwestern establishments in the Phoenix metro area.  

The patio and open bar are fantastic.  The bar area is considerable, and the patio is palatial - up above Lincoln Dr enough to be fairly quiet, with a gorgeous view of Camelback, sunset here must be incredible.  

Anyway, back to the food.  Everything was very well executed, from the sticky buns we were served upon being seated to the desserts we ordered.  I chose the soup of the day to start, a tomato/basil concoction that was quite hearty and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The salads my dining companions ate looked boring to me, but they all claimed them to be excellent, with ""the best Caesar dressing ever"" and ""polenta croutons?!?"" being the verdict for the Caesar salad, at least.  On to the entrees.  I ordered the crispy duck, which I found to be delicious and quite hearty, though not what I would call crispy by any means.  It was a very sizable portion, and very well prepared.  My dining companions ordered the pork chop, the lamb, and the salmon, and we each sampled from each other's plates.  I would try the lamb if I went back, but the consensus seemed to be that everything was very well prepared, with the duck being a winner.  It was served with a heap of mushy sweet potatoes (just like my mom makes at Thanksgiving - delicious!) and red cabbage, which I sampled and declined to finish.  Again, not quite my style.  

We moved on to dessert - sticky bread pudding with a bourbon glaze and the warm chocolate cake.  The bread pudding was a winner at the first two or three bites, but grew one-dimensional as I continued nibbling at it.  The chocolate cake was decadent, among the best I've ever tasted.  It was clearly made with a considerable amount of dark chocolate, which seals the deal for me.  And in case you were wondering, my dining companions apparently have no stamina when it comes to dessert.  Suckers.  

Anyway, as I've said now several times, this place is just not quite me.  It's totally classy and very high in quality, but not quite adventurous enough for my taste.  I'd love to come back for brunch, and once they unveil their happy hour menu, I'm sure I'll be back to check it out, but I won't be back for dinner unless I can convince someone else to pick up the check at the end of the evening.  

As a side note, this place is so very Paradise Valley.  It's a welcome relief knowing that there is a place that is so anti-scene out there.

Unfortunately after the last experience, I can't go back.  Although they are very nice and have great prices, I have to reveal the ugly truth: 
1. They don't put any effort into sanitizing the tools or the pedicure bowl. I actually saw them clean the brushes and tools in the water I was soaking my feet in and then just rinse out the bowl after they were done... not spray, soap, nothing!
2. Reason #1 probably explains why my heals cracked so severely after my pedicure that they began to bleed.  I had to use peroxide, neosprin, and bandages for almost a week to get it heal.

I had kung pao beef - it was a little too crispy.  My partner had the shrimp version (she wanted scallops but they were out !) - she said it was excellent.

Liked the decor, but a bit pricey for what you got.",neutral,en
4,"Had the pleasure of enjoying House of Tricks last night, for the second time in the past twelve months.

With a party of six, I was excited to get to see a range of dishes and try out most of the menu via my dining companions choices.  The restaurant, found in Tempe near ASU, is not hard to find and houses both indoor and outdoor seating.  The outdoor seating is where we ended up last night and between the fire pit in the middle of the grounds and the abundance of trees/greenery, the setting works quite well.  

Our party was seated immediately and without problem, the night was off to a solid start.  Our waitress, Jamie, was both friendly and courteous.  Jamie had a great understanding of the menu, the specials and especially the wine.  Her recommendations for multiple members of the party worked out perfectly.  Each person in our party ordered an appetizer and off we went.

I had the pork belly, on Jamie's suggestion. Other choices within our party included the salmon cake, sweetbreads two ways, and the scallops.  I thought the pork belly was great. It had a pea puree as a base sauce and some baby carrots that just killed.  The scallops were tasty and cooked perfectly.  The sweetbreads two ways were a bit of a letdown.  As a lover of sweetbreads, I have had the pleasure of tasting some of the best variations of there preparation. These were just not that great.  They weren't cooked properly and the seasoning was lacking.  This would be the only lacking dish of the evening.

For the entree, I had the pork osso bucco.  This was a real treat, cooked evenly, tender and tasty.  Other entree selections around the table included the ahi tuna, the salmon, and the duck.  The tuna was the standard seared variety on a bed of mashed potatoes.  Both diners who chose this selection were quite satisfied.  My companion had the duck and while she certainly enjoyed the dish, she found the duck slightly fatty.  All around, the entrees were solid and plates were cleaned.  

With little room left for dessert, we ordered three selections for the table to share.  All were good and once again our plates were cleaned off.  The dessert best was agreed upon to be the homemade smore the restaurant produces.  

All in all, this is a solid restaurant with a good atmosphere and good service.  I would eat here again and recommend you to do the same.",positive,en
4,"We tried Mr Chao's Asian Bistro last night. It's a small place and they do a lot of take-out orders. The quirky interior works fine for me. My wife thought the single gourami looked kind of sad in the small, flat tank on the wall. They have a bar and a decent selection of wine for a small restaurant. I tried one of the specials, the Hunan Smoked Pork. It was basically kind of like bacon stir-fried with fresh vegetables with a spicy Hunan black bean sauce. I love bacon and I really liked this dish. My wife had prawns w/vegetables, we liked the freshness of the vegetables and generous amount of prawns but overall the dish was slightly bland. She liked it but thought that it would have been better with the lobster sauce. We were mixed on the iced tea, my wife felt it was too strong but I thought it was fine. 

Overall, Mr Chao's is a fine choice in Ahwatukee for Americanized Chinese food. It is a bit pricier than our usual stop, Panda Garden, but a nice alternative.",positive,en

5,"We attended this restaurant for an early seating at 5 p.m. and were immediately impressed with the atmosphere and professional staff.   Both were first class.

We decided to sit at the counter overlooking the chefs preparing the food and we were glad we did.  One young fellow was more than happy to answer any questions we had regarding the preparation as well as the presentation of the food.  It really was fun to watch the whole process.

We decided to go straight to the entree instead of filling up on an appetizer beforehand and we were glad we chose to do that.  We each ordered the Kobe Vaca Encebollada, which was a grilled Kobe skirt steak nestled on a bed of caramelized onions.  Alongside the steak were three slices of potato about a half inch thick and these were topped with a guacamole type mixture as well as other toppings.  They were absolutely delicious and I was so sad to reach the end of those.  The steak was cooked to absolute perfection and I was determined to clean my plate because it, too, was just so scrumptious!  It was a very ample portion and we did clean our plates and definitely had no room for dessert, unfortunately.  As our cocktail, we followed another reviewers lead and ordered virgin mojitos, which were $9.50/ea and they were delicious and also sufficed as a dessert stand-in so the tab wasn't too crazy at all.  Well worth it for that delicious steak.

We did dress up for the occasion and were glad we did as everyone was dressed casually but nice.  It's fun to have the whole experience for a special night out.  

We look forward to returning soon.",positive,en
4,"Before all of you band together to burn me at the stake, let me explain.  I have a reason for wanting to review a chain such as Del Taco!

I went here the other day and was shocked.  The staff is nice.  And I'm not just talking fake friendly.  They were genuinely kind and seemed happy to be at work.  In fact, the guy at the counter asked me how my weekend was, so in return, I asked about his.  You know what he said?  ""Perfect.""  He said his weekend was perfect.  I can't remember the last time I had a perfect weekend.  Lucky him.

The food is pretty good too and I especially enjoy their spicy jack quesadilla.  My nachos did not come with any cheese though- not sure if that was a mistake or not.  Just chips.  False advertising. 

Anyways, everyone who works there was exceptionally nice.  Why?  This has never happened to me before.  Was I their first customer of the day or are they really just nice people happy with their jobs?  They must pay well there... Is the secret to being happy in life working at Del Taco??",positive,en
1,"WOW!  I have never been to a place with service this horrible.  I may have caught them on a bad night, but I'm not giving them a second chance to find out!

I came in with a group of 4.  We stood up front for 5-10 minutes before waving someone down to be seated.  That was a mistake..

As we're waiting for a server to take our drink order, we noticed that EVERY single table had empty cups waiting to be refilled, dirty plates that needed bussing, and people with impatient faces.  There was only 1-2 dedicated servers, and they completely ignored us.

We stuck around just to see how long it would take before someone took our drink order, it was like being in the Twilight Zone.  After 30 minutes and flagging down 3 employees, we just walked out laughing, no one had even apologized for the wait, I'm not sure they even saw us leave!  It was the strangest restaurant experience of my life.

What a joke...

**EDIT**  To their credit, right after I posted this review, I received a message explaining that the Director of Operations would like to amend the situation, even going so far as to include their cell number.  I admit that I feel strange posting such a negative statement amid all the 4 and 5 star reviews, I'm assuming I caught them on a really bad night.  I'll edit this if I ever return to the restaurant, but the fact that someone actually reached out to try to rectify things says something",negative,en
2,"Five Guys is great for those days when you want to spend $12 on a glorified fast-food hamburger. The meat comes in a wafer-thin patty, and doesn't really taste like anything, just like at Wendy's. The bun tastes mass-produced. 

I also don't especially care for their fries, although this is a matter of taste more than anything. I'm not generally one for mushy, thick, ""natural"" fries of the sort served here. 

I can't help but wonder if people rate this place purely on the quantity of food that you get. The normal size for the burger is a double-patty, and the fries come overflowing from a 12 oz. drink cup. 

I would rank the burger places around mill as:
1) Smashburger, for their delicious Arizona burger, and the awesome smash fries
2) Chuckbox, for delicious char-grilled meat that actually tastes like meat
3) In-n-out, for great-tasting meat and some of my favorite fries
4) Five Guys,

We got a to go order, perhaps that was mistake numero uno.  I got the nachos.. really, you can't mess those up... Or so I thouhgt! I mean Filiberto's would have been a better choice!  Can you say cold soggy mess.. maybe that was my fault. I will accept the blame. I really should have known better. 

Mistake numero dos... What do you call Shrimp Cocktail with out the shrimp?? Bad Service! Lack of quality control....Really.. Really? You forgot the shimp? How do you do that.... Better question WHO DOES THAT?

Mistake numero tres...lemme just say burned tasting chips (as opposed to my soggy nacho chips) and left an acrid taste in ones mouth and the most offending guacamole that I have ever had. 

Let me just say that my co worker and I eat here frequently enough that we can order for each other. We also know to order our guacamole with out the Grand Marnier galze thingy on top.

The other friend ordered the mushroom corn quesadilla.  She liked it but didn't love it.  I had the shrimp tacos and, wow, were they good.

2,"According to the reviews I have read for this spot, I must have ordered from them on an off day. Today for delivery, I ordered a cup of soup (something tomato based with potatoes and beef in it), 1/2 Vermonter sandwich, lemonade and a cookie. 

The soup was ok (bland, but ok), the sandwich was...well, kind of sad looking. A big dark green piece of wilted lettuce, barely any of the 'cranberry mayo' or whatever was supposed to be the mayo on there, the turkey and ham tasted great...there just wasn't very much of it, and they completely forgot my request for a side of mayo, mustard and a knife/fork on a triangle cut piece of wheat bread. I wasn't able to choose my chips, so ended up with some plain ones and my cookie was undercooked by about 10 minutes. The outer circle was baked, but the rest was cookie moosh. (Which is fine when you are in a cookie dough mood, but alas...I was not.) The lemonade was FANTASTIC though. I don't believe I'll be trying this one again unless I'm in a pinch, but I'm happy I tried them today instead of just jumping into a catering order with them. This may be the only time I have been mislead by previous Yelps. *sigh*",negative,en

3,"Meh... I am surprised to read all the reviews about the clean store everyone else wrote about. In my experience, the toppings area looked like it had all merged to become one big nest. There were also speckles and swipes of fro-yo in all places imaginable... floor, counters, scale... And, I wanted to try a couple flavors, but there was no one around to help. Also, the checkout lady was soooooo dreary! With her monotone listlessness, she made me feel as depressed as Sylvia Plath! (just kidding, but she couldn't have been more doldrums if she tried)

I usually go to Yogurtology at Town & Country mall (on Camelback just east of the 51). That place is always amazing... Pristine clean, neat, organized, always a peppy guy by the machines with little sampler cups, a guy who had one too many Red Bulls and is nearly throwing at least one sample of every single flavor at every single person who walks in the door, with a funny, witty little quip and a great personality and WAY too damn much energy. But it's nice.

THAT is what I had in mind when I discovered THIS place. I was excited. It was so much nearer to my house... great location (stupid layout though, prone to human traffic jams).

I really, really want to like Yogurtland, but I just can't talk myself into it. The fro-yo was good (aside from the fact that I had trouble getting toppings without being too grossed out since it was a mess), but that was about it. All in all, they're lucky I felt generous today and gave them 3 stars, because I really had to talk myself out of giving them only 2.

3,"I've lived near Old Town Scottsdale for years and in all that time I've never really taken to the streets by foot, aside from a weekly visit to the Farmers Market. At first glance you ask yourself how many Indian jewelry shops can the area possibly sustain? Well the answer is, the turquoise market in Old Town seems to be doing quite well. So it was on a recent exploration trip that we happened upon David's Hamburger's and Mexican Food. So for me the idea of killer burger and tasty Mexican good is a match made in heaven, were talking major food groups here. 

Tucked between 2 galleries, David's is a blink and you'll miss it kind of place, very unassuming and humble. Inside you won't be wowed by the interior design but what they do have is functional and comfortable. With TV's at both ends of the hall like space, you'll be entertained by performance videos of 50's era rock 'n roll. 

I usually don't write much about soda pop, well never, but in this case the Cherry Coke ($1.95) was kind of special. When you order a Coke you can ask them to add a number of different flavorings from lemon and vanilla to chocolate and of course cherry. David's version is wonderfully fizzy and cuts through the richness of the upcoming meal. 

Of all the ways Mexican style meat is prepared, the grilled taste of beef is my all time favorite. If you enjoy this as much as I do then Id suggest the Carne Asada Nachos ($8.59). A massive pile of crunchy tortilla chips is covered in grilled beef strips, melted cheese, guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo. While basic, I ate most of them myself leaving my partner to scraping the cheese off of the plate. If you'd like salsa on your chips, be sure to ask them to bring you bowls of green and red salsa. 

Now who doesn't like a big juicy hamburger? David's doesn't disappoint with David's Single ($5.99), say that 2 times fast. A 1/3lb patty topped with the usual suspects, then dressed with David's creamy sauce which to me was a thick version of Thousand Isle dressing, adding a layer of tangy goodness. Along side you have your choice of fries or you can choose to upgrade ($.99) to a mix of large deep fried onion rings and golden French fries. For dipping I a side of David's sauce did the trick in lieu of ketchup. 

The Patty Melt ($7.25) is classic diner food. We're talking thick ground beef patty, melted cheese and grilled onions on your choice of grilled sourdough or rye bread. The wholesome grease from the beef patty and grilled onions is absorbed into the bread creating a creamy like texture, for me this is what a patty melt is all about. Of course the Guacamole Burger ($6.25) with its pepper jack cheese, bacon and guacamole is the marriage of Mexican and American influence. 

If you're an early riser, David's also serves breakfast like Bacon Pancakes ($6.75) and Coconut Waffles ($6.25). Someone please pass the syrup. My only question, where is the breakfast burrito?",neutral,en
5,"NOCA...  wow.

Have you seen the outer limits show where the chef owns a device that when placed in a small room with a single person drives the person completely insane with fear but creates a liquid extract that adds complete and utter bliss to food.  That liquid is then added to  the restaurant's soup which is revered as the best soup in the word.  Limit 1 bowl per person...?

NOCA must have gotten their hands on this relic.  Honestly.  This has probably been the best dining experience of my life.   Everything was delicious on its own, all together, or when combining just a few of the items on the plate.  

Walked in and our server seated us.  They brought us an amuse-bouche that had a small amount of blue cheese, chorizo, and chives.  Was delicious.  Then bread was served. After that, our Bacon and Egg was served.  This was phenomenal.  A crispy perfectly poached egg with oh so tender pork belly....mmmm

My fiance ordered the butternut squash cannelloni and I ordered the duck.  Both were amazing.  The duck was so moist and tender but not greasy at all.  We then were served cotton candy as we waiting on our 2 desserts to arrive.  We had the donuts and the de-constructed cheesecake.  I had an espresso and my fiance had the vanilla malted milk shake.

All of this was amazing.  My fiance wasn't in the mood for wine, so I delved into the beer list and low and behold, 90 minute IPA from dogfish head.... NOCA, I love you.",positive,en
5,"Bliss, Delight, Contentment... words to describe our evening Monday night at Sens. I could go into a very fluffy review, but, with a nod to the simple zen-like restaurant, I will only address and highlight. 

~Spa Like atmosphere - welcomed and enjoyed.
~Attentive, but not aggressive server...great attitude! 
~The Bar Menu I expect to see if I go to heaven. 
~Homemade infused alcohol.. finally in Phoenix! 
~Open kitchen, I was able to watch the chef CRAFT my meal. 

All items served ""tapas"" style... great opportunity to try many items! 

Food is prepared and served to allow the diner to choose the experience... either enjoy the food natural, or enhance with dipping sauces. These are not the heavy, sticky sauces of Pei Wei fame. 

~Mango Spring roll.. light, fresh items in rice paper 2 rolls sliced 

~Soup Gyoza, 4 little light dumplings filled with pork and a delicate broth..divine! 

~Volcano Beef sear your own tender beef strips (5) on the hot stone, then wrap it up in a lettuce leaf with herbs and peanuts,... try a dip of the accompanying sauce...ecstasy, prepare to order 2 they're so good! 

~Panko Shrimp - liken to little shrimp ""hushpuppys"".. very good, but not the highlight of the evening.. Mr Chu could improve upon these in my opinion. 

~ Red Thai Curry - 4 unique, yummy curry / coconut milk dipped wings perched on a Asian ""slaw"" 

~Spicy Wontons - Americans will love these.. familiar flavors, with wonderful dipping sauces. 

No-one in our party was disappointed... everyone was very pleased and anxious to return.

2,"""We wanted to take you out for your last dinner...so we got to thinking 'what place has specials on a Tuesday?'..and I remembered Chompie's has a special..AND A FOOD CHALLENGE.""

And THAT is how I ended up at Chompie's on a Tuesday.  They were featured on TV (I think it's Man Vs. Food, but I'm not sure) bc of this food challenge of theirs.  On Tuesdays, they have a special - AYCE Jewish sliders & fries with the purchase of a beverage for $11.95.  (Keep in mind, a plate of 3 Jewish sliders + fries is $11.95.)

I was told the specialties here are sliders.  The sliders themselves are a decent size (I'd say maybe it's the same size as the tiny McD's burgers, but taller?).  Jewish sliders have potato cakes in them; Western sliders don't; breakfast sliders are something completely different.

Everything we ordered was ehhhh (befitting of a ""meh, I've experienced better"" rating).  Two things that did impress me, however, were:

1. They place pickles on the table right when you sit down!  I'm not a pickle girl myself, but it's a nice gesture.
2. Everyone here is so FRIENDLY (I mean genuinely friendly!!).  Idk, I think most Arizonians in general are friendlier than the Californians I encounter on a daily basis hahahhaa.  And our waitress went out of her way to split 5 checks for our party of 7...that was pretty cool of her.

4,"This is my favorite Tapas joint in town. It's a place I have to get the same thing everytime and maybe more to try a few new items... my must haves are:

Island Gingered Yam & Pumpkin Bisque Soup (Seasonal)... so good and the fact that it's seasonal makes it even more of a special treat.

Camarones Al Ajillo (Garlic Shrimp)... this is my all time favoreite dish thus far @ Havana... I can eat it as my meal as long as they provide me as much of their tasty bread as I need to sop the dish dry of all the yummy garlic sauce it contains.

Maduras Fritos... Fried plantains... need I say more?

Mojito... best in town in terms of authenticity.

Marquesas de Chocolate aka Chocolate Pate... I never cared for dessert here until I tasted this strangely named treat. It is so rich at first you think it will be too little but then you realize you need to share with everyone at your table.

Other worthy options: 
Arroz Con Pollo... It has baby peas in it and I really don't like peas... but I like them in this dish! I got to try this dish because a friend ordered it as his meal and didn't even make a dent in it... so I got all the leftovers and it was pretty tasty and economical!

Fritoras de Frijoles Negros... I've never had Black Bean Fritters before--they are quite tasty dipped in Guacamole!

Calypso Chips...A thinner more chippy version of Fried Plantains.

Sun Spots... Sweet Potato Fritters pretty tasty as well... for a fried root vegetable!

Datiles Con Chorizo... A meatier appetizer... not the best I've had but pretty darn good.

Empanaditas... These are alright... though I'm partial to Filipino style Empanadas... but since I have no place to buy them from, nor have I mastered making them, these are quite good for a band-aid craving.

Tamal Cubano... pretty tasty, but my fave is the soupier Salvadorean take on the chicken tamale.

Flan... haven't had it, but flan consistency throughout varying cultures seems pretty consistent.

Free Goodness: Their Bread! It's just the way I like it, hot, thin and crisp crust and soft in the middle!

As you can see, outside of the Arroz Con Pollo, I have not tried many of their entrees... I'm quite content to dine with others and share Havana's wonderful tapas... but one day I WILL try their Paella. A vegetarian friend said they make a veggie paella that was pretty tasty... and she loves their Mojitos just as much as I do so I think she may be right on this one.

My standards for quality froyo are high since I frequent Yogurtology (Shea and Scottsdale), Yogurtland (I'm the Duke in Scottsdale), and sometimes I go to Mojo in Tempe. 

This place has ""ok"" flavors. I had the original tart, that was quite a bit tart. The toppings are ok. My friend really liked the fact that they have banana chips, but that's because we usually eat our froyo at home and we were far away from home, and she didn't have to use her personal stash. 

Since it made her happy, I gave this place an extra star. I'm cool like that.

Hmm...let's see. They have a snow machine. Not really sure what this is for. It seems out of place. 

It's far from my house, and not really worth my drive. I guess if it was by my house, and I had no other options, I'd frequent this business.

Was lucky to get a booth inside but it wasn't as clean as others have stated in other reviews.  I had to take one of their comment cards and wipe the table of all crumbs on the ground as others had obviously done from the looks of the floor.  I had the Chipotle Cheese Steak sub that I split with my husband.  The bread tasted ok, but it wasn't fresh out of the oven. They skimpt on the steak and hardly saw any onions at all on it.  For the price of the sandwich I really was expecting to get more.  The sauce was the best thing about it but I was wanting more of it as well.  I won't be going back.

Some of us hangout at a restaurant to make it a working meal...and sometimes, during that time Nature calls...so I asked the busboy to not clear my table as I needed to step away for a moment and he cheerfully agreed. I came back to find my table cleared by new patrons who had taken it upon themselves to steal my table (I guess the fact that the food was only half eaten, and the water and coffee were still half filled were no clue). The busboy was upset that he'd turned his back for just a moment and Jeff came to the rescue...after apologizing to me and finding the perfect way to make it right, he vowed to let the new people know that they were rather um 'overly proactive' in clearing the table themselves and that he had some people who regularly relaxed and worked in the restaurant and do step away.

He handled the situation with me just right and I am sure that those people that took my table were made to gently understand that they need to ask before taking an uncleared table.

Kudos to Jeff and the staff for making me so happy I had to tell everyone here...and to the couple who took my table, if you are reading this...did you REALLY need that booth? I mean, when I came out of the can there were like, I dunno, 5 empty tables...seriously? Like, did you propose there or something????",positive,en

Came here for a happy hour, had a drink called the Tokyo Tease(delish!) and since I love sashimi sushi (which isn`t on the happy hour menu, no big deal), ordered my sashimi combo, which didn`t disappoint!! Included tuna, salmon and yellowtail. Did enjoy the bevy of assorted rolls that went by. I like the outside/inside seating bar- great on beautiful weather days! I will be back for more!!",positive,en
3,"We went to dinner there on a Sunday and we were the only ones in there for most of our dinner. Downtown Phoenix can be somewhat quiet on the weekends, so this was no surprise. The service was great as was the food. I had a pizza and if you like thin, crispy crust you will enjoy the pizza as well. The music was a little loud for a Sunday dinner, especially since we were pretty much the only ones in the restaurant. I will go again, probably during the week so I can get a taste of what it is like when it is busy!! Overall...decent meal!",neutral,en
2,"We went there for dinner in April 2011. The dishes are hit and miss, and all are over priced. My wife ordered pad thai, and it was horrible. Instead of the traditional, flavorful dish with peanut and bean sprout, this dish at Flo's is just a salty, chicken noodle. My wife and I both took a bite, we had to send it back. It was not edible. Too salty. Only chicken and rice noodle. There was no peanut, no bean sprout, no pepper, no egg, no ..... Basically, it was NOT a pad thai at all. 

On the upside, my son ordered a sweet&sour chicken, and it was better than most places. They used fresh pineapples.

Based on food quality, ambience, and dinner prices, I say there are tons of other places that are better.",negative,en
4,"OK, Sweet Pea and I love us some Coup, and it's not just because we've been coming here for years- since I lived across the street and could see the restaurant from my window- or because we got engaged here (which was incredible.)  It's because the food never disappoints.  You can go to restaurants and have varying experiences from the best meal of your life to terrible, but Coup is not the place for that.  It's consistent.  And consistent can be good, or bad.
As consistently good as the food is, the service is likewise consistently slow (albeit friendly).  We went here for Valentine's day which we've been several times and I highly recommend.  It's romantic without being showy.  They have a special Valentine's Day set menu of 4 courses which is always interesting and good.  And, if you go on the day before Valentine's Day, they still have the menu, but it's cheaper.  Damn those greeting card ""holidays"".  The menu is also consistent.  The outstanding things are the brie brulee which is an absolute must-try as an appetizer, and the lamb shank.  Everything else is solidly good without being great.  The desserts are exceptional.  I like the BYOB aspect of the restaurant, although, they do charge you a lot for ""corking fees"", which amount to just charging you for nothing since they have a corkscrew sitting on the table and you are in charge of opening your own bottle.
Coup, I love you.  You get 5 stars if you vary your menu a little, please, please, please get more vegetarian (if any vegetarian) options, and improve your service.",positive,en
3,"Overall I liked this place and glad it is in the neighborhood.  The carne asada burrito was good and the ceviche was pretty tasty.  However, it seems that this is about all there is to the menu.  

I was not a fan of the set-up of the restaurant.  It was way too crowded - yes it was lunch, but the flow could have been a lot better.  Overall, I will return when in the mood for carne asada.  Hopefully the kinks will get worked out over time and until then I look forward to supporting a local restaurant.",neutral,en

1,"I ate at Scramble last Friday and I have to say that it was a horrible experience.  What attracted me to this place was the separate vegan menu in addition to their regular menu - this makes things easier when dining with vegan and non-vegan friends.  So I happily ordered a tofu wrap and added fried potatoes as a side and awaited my food.  We started eating and my friend found a hair in his food...not good!  He threw it on the floor and tried to drop it.  Well moments later I found a hair in my food...  I couldn't believe there was hair on both of our plates!  I was so disgusted I could no longer eat my food (and I was ravenous).  I told the girl working the register about the whole ordeal, she walked back to the kitchen then back to the register and completely ignored me (she said she'd come back to my table).  Before we left I spoke with someone else and showed them the hair, clearly not one of mine.  All I got was ""Oh, I'll check the guys in the back.""  Check the guys in the back???  What?  How about, sorry may I refund you your money?  Additionally, the few bites I had of my burrito were pretty bland, it needed seasoning or hot sauce.  Overall, I wouldn't go back...unless I somehow develop a taste for hair, although I'm sure that won't happen.  I did take a picture of my food before I attempted eating it and if you zoom in enough you can see part of the hair sticking out of my food - I'll be posting them.",negative,en

4,"The 4 stars is in comparison to other Chipotle's I've been to, especially in this area.

I have to admit, when they were building this plaza, my friends and I tried to guess every day what it was going to be. We had it narrowed down to a Chipotle or a sushi joint (both would kill me for sure) and I cannot believe we were actually right. 

I am pretty pleased with this place. Both times I've stopped by it's been clean and pretty speedy service. Every time I come in, I am surprised by all the extra room around to the side and out on the patio and it makes me happy.

I'm sure anyone reading this has been to Chipotle, but if not, or if you're feeling like trying something new.. my signature dish for the past few years has been carnitas bowl with black beans, corn, fajita, lettuce and a little bit of the dairy stuff.

2,"Okay...this was very surprising since it was just voted Best Southwestern food in PHX mag's Best of the Valley issue...and thus, it made us want to have a visit.

I LOVE southwestern food...and I was very let down by this place.  I feel like I should give it 3 stars...but as an ""A-OK"" rating, I just can't.  If 3 stars were for ""OK food"" then I'd give it 3 stars.  But truly, I have...I have had better.

PHX Mag said to try the crab cakes, which we did, and they were delicious.  Very happy with them and therefore expected the entrees to be just as great...but they weren't.  : (  I had the salmon, which the waitress recommended and it was such a bummer.  It had way too many conflicting tastes going on that didn't seem to blend at all.  I lost my appetite after a few bites.  My boyfriend had the shrimp tacos which were just...average.  We were really disappointed.  

Again, the crab cake appetizer was great and the two margaritas were as well - the Tontorita and the Prickly Pear - both very, very yummy.  

But overall, if PHX Mag continues to recommend more lame-oid meals, I'm gonna have to start using it as wrapping paper instead of a go-to guide for great meals in this town.",negative,en

5,"After visiting family in Scottsdale last weekend, hubby and I spent 3 wonderful days at the Boulders Resort in Carefree. We arrived a little tired and stressed; we left tan, relaxed, and rejuvenated.

The resort sprawls beneath the boulder formations, but you can walk all over on the paths that are well marked. Our room was spacious and clean, with his and hers sinks in the bathroom, shower, tub, king sized bed, and walk-in closet. We were located near the main lodge, and a brisk walk from El Pedregal and the Golden Door Spa. We made great use of the wonderful fitness center and took a few classes as well- yoga, bosu, and water fitness.

We tried both pools during our stay, the spa pool and the main pool. We preferred the tranquility of the spa pool; food and drinks at both locations were exceptional. If you meet Madonna at either pool, ask her to make the ""Madonna Special"" for you. A very refreshing smoothie.

During our stay we ate dinner twice at the Spotted Donkey Cantina at El Pedregal- fabulous margaritas shrimp tacos. Our last night we dined at Rusty's Chop House at the golf club. It was a lovely meal on the terrace with a view of the golf course. 

Every person we ran into was exceptionally friendly and genuine, making the trip even more enjoyable. I hope we return someday!",positive,en

The pizza can be a little greasy sometimes (but hey, it's pizza), but as long as it doesn't soak through and make the crust all flimsy (which has never happened with the pizzas I get here!) it's nothing that a paper towel or two can't fix! I'm not a big wing person but my dad has had them and he says they're pretty good.

4,"I went for lunch with a large group and the place was pleasantly empty. The decor is very modern and has a comfortable lounge style.

The chips and salsa are a great starter. You get three tasty kinds of salsa: brown, red, and pico de gallo. The tortilla chips are fried perfectly. They are extremely light and crispy.

I tried the steak tostadas. The meat had a food flavor and the tortillas were nice and crunchy. The red jalape√±o and fresh cilantro on top brought excitement to each bite. 

The dishes are small, but they are are also inexpensive at $6-10 each. Along with the chips and salsa, I got plenty of food, so portion sizes are only an issue for big eaters. It seems like a great place to share several dishes between everyone. 

I would definately go back for the food, but I wonder if this place becomes a standing-room only drunk fest when it gets busier and later in the evening (if so, no thanks).",positive,en

the place is pretty cute but can get pretty crowded when in the full swing of lunch. the tables are kind of close together, so be sure you arent carrying a big purse or anything otherwise you'll be whacking people in the head with it.

i had the pad thai for lunch. HUGE lunch portions. i could barely finish a third of it and i had a ton to take home for dinner. also if you arent into spicy, i'd definitely go mild. medium spicy is pretty groovin, but i dont think it would work out well for someone who only wants a little spice. yupha's also has an interesting salad bar/soup thing that comes with some of the lunches. check out the salad with the peanut dressing. mmmmmm peanut dressing. i loves it.

1,"Had some time to kill before the Ultimate pleY Date Yelp event, and I'd wanted to share my love of Nobuo's Dark chocolate mousse with green tea ice cream and sugared orange peels with my happy-go-lucky cousin, who has never been here before, so we stopped by at 5:17p to find that Nobuo wouldn't open till 5:30p, so we waited outside in the comfortable patio.

After watching a couple of employees add lanterns to their outdoor umbrellaed tables, I noticed the ""OPEN"" sign on the front door, so we entered the resto, whereupon we were greeted warmly by a male host and shown to a two-top.  I didn't like the energy in that room, so I asked if we could sit elsewhere, and he said to choose wherever we wanted to sit.  We were the first customers, so we chose a four-top, knowing we wouldn't be taking up space for very long, anyway.  Glasses of water were delivered, and soon we met our female server (whose name on the receipt reflected ""Butai"").  When she laid down the menus, I told her we would only be having dessert and could we see the dessert menu?  I wished we had a video of the look she gave us, a look of pure distaste, as she gathered up the dinner and beverage menus and said ""We don't have dessert menus, as we only have two..."" and proceeded to tell us of the mousse and the almond-orange fritters.  She walked away, and as we loudly discussed about our losing our interest in dining there, she came back with napkins and utensils and asked if we decided what we were going to have.  I decided to forgo our server's very cold treatment and asked for the mousse.  After all, I'd already finished a glass of ice-cold water and cousin's phone needed recharging...  

When Butai placed our chocolate mousse http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg#rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg on the table, I wanted to send it back.  Where was the lovely bowl and presentation of the last dessert I had here?  Was she serious in presenting us with this stale-looking mousse, with cracked edges and whose green tea ice cream had ice crystals on it?  I don't know about you, but the only times I've seen crystals on ice cream is when it has slightly melted and placed back in the freezer to re-freeze.  For me, seeing crystals on ice cream is a sign that it is old...  I brought the receptacle and showed it to the male host, who assured me that all of the mousse is made daily at 4:00a and seeing cracks and bubbles in the mousse is normal, so I decided we would go ahead and try it, if for nothing else but to have something to report here.  The dessert was definitely not up to par with the pretty bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ#o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ I had during our October OYE in taste and presentation, but it was OK.  The mousse was still cold and stiff, and it had a mouth-feel more of like thick chocolate ganache filling/icing on a cake- certainly not the silky-smooth chocolate decadence I knew it could be.  My cousin had to warm up to the dish, as the sound of chocolate and green tea together didn't seem like a great combo to her (I told her to trust me).  She also never enjoyed orange and chocolate together, but she liked it in this dessert.  

I understand that the knowledge of having to serve only dessert instead of dinner AND dessert, which translates to a higher table bill, can be a bit of a disappointment, but why must you show your displeasure to your guests?  Butai, you were lucky that my cousin even left you the change for a tip- she didn't want to give you anything, and you certainly didn't deserve it!  When I told other Yelp friends about the sub-par service and dessert we just had, one replied she didn't enjoy the last time we had apps here (I think it was around Halloween and First Friday?) either.  Cousin and I thought it very poor taste that our server gave us that awful, condescending look after finding out we were just going to have dessert; We didn't deserve that!  I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore.  I even promised my Japanese friend (who lives and works overseas) I'd treat her to a dining experience here when she comes to visit.  Guess I'll have to find another place to take her...  I don't want to risk getting the same treatment from Butai, or from another server should we come back here.  

Sorry, Nobuo, but I won't be returning.",negative,en
1,"This may be my worst dining experience ever.

The scenery was beautiful, we can't complain about that. The menu was decent, there was a good number of selections to choose from. However the prices were definitely high, we're just talking tacos & burritos here...

I ordered a taco salad with steak. It was $11.99, for lunch...which I thought was crazy.  When I got the salad, it was the cheap iceberg lettuce, with a couple tomatoes & a few onions. The steak was DISCUSTING. I wouldn't feed a dog that steak meat. I asked the waiter for some salad dressing, he gave me this funny look and said ""most people just use salsa, but I guess I can get you some ranch or something"". Great service, huh? I asked the waiter about the margarittas, and he willingfully told me that the 3 cheapest ones are no good and are too watered down. Nice...so I then asked about the Patron Margaritta (my fav tequilla). The Patron rita was $16!!! 

The waiter was extremely unprofessional, and even gave us this pitch about how he's only working there until he finds a new ""gig"". The prices were ridiculous! I would NEVER go there again and hope to share my story with many people before they waste their money!!",negative,en

Our complaint about Spitfire is that the owner and staff is never very welcoming. My fiancee and I have been there 15+ times and there is never any recognition by the staff. The owner is always there and he has never introduced himself or thanked us for coming in again.  The servers have never said 'welcome back or good to see you again'. For a neighborhood restaurant I would think you would want to make your regular customers feel appreciated. We love the food and the restaurant is right around the corner from our house, but we lean toward other, farther away restaurants with a more weloming feel.
For example, last night we went to House of Tricks in Tempe. It was our 4th visit. When we walked in three of the employees greeted us and welcomed us back. The bartenders remembered what we drink and asked us about something we discussed last time we were there.
Talk about feeling welcome! Spitfire has a lot to learn if they want to survive in a neighborhood lacation.",neutral,en

3,"After living 2 blocks away for over a year, i finally took the jump and decided to deal with the long wait to try this place out.  Got there at 7:30 on a Tuesday night... 2.5 hour wait.  (To be expected, but still pretty ridiculous.)  

Went next door to Bar Bianco, ordered a bottle of wine and patiently waited outside.  I think that the wait is part of the allure for people.  Also, after waiting hungry for 3 hours, the food becomes tastier because you are starving.  

Finally get a table at 10:15.  Order the caprese salad and another bottle of wine.  The ingredients are very fresh.  The Mozz is excellent, the tomatoes are very very fresh and tasty and the basil was great as well.  

The server didnt make any recommendations on wine or food.  A bit odd.  Given that the wait is 3 hours and that it's pricy for a pizza joint, you'd think that the service would be excellent.  Not at all the case.  This guy acts like everyone here is a regular.  The reality is that with 3 hour waits for a table, i don't have time to be a regular at this place. 

We ordered 2 pizzas to try.... Biancoverde and Wiseguy.  They were pretty good, again with good ingredients.  I wouldn't say it was the best pizza i've ever had, but very tasty.  Asked for some Balsamic to go with the Mozz and Tomatoes... had to ask the server 2 times, finally we snagged a food runner, she got it for us.  I shouldnt have to ask for something 3 times. I mean really, this place only has like 6 tables... pay attention to the guests.  

I guess the moral here is that trying this place is all about the experience and saying that you've been there.  While Bianco is good you can go to Parlor or Cibo and get very good (comparable) pizza without a 3 hour wait.  

Is it good, yes. 
Is it worth the wait, nope.",neutral,en
2,"I really like this concept for a quick breakfast/brunch spot, but the execution wasn't too delicious. If you know me well enough, you'll know my first thought when we walked in was ""is there booze???"" The answer is yes. I recall seeing your typical breakfast bevies such as mimosas, bellinis, bloody mary's, etc.

So you go in, scope out the menu, order at the counter, and they bring you your meal and beverages. I ordered a simple eggs, potatoes, toast and sausage breakfast, and my friend had an omelette. We had just had brunch at Maizie's the day prior and our first impression was disappointment in the portions of the food, considering the prices were also comparable. Oddly, my sausage, potatoes and sunny side eggs had the same consistency, so that was off for me. They were all a bit soft and soggy. We, of course, enjoyed the mimosa and bellini, but $5 each is a bit high considering they're $3 @ at other places, and Cafe Boa down the block offers unlimited mimosas for a fixed fee with food. 

I thought the location was great, and the Sunday brunch crowd was nice. I'm not sure what it will be like when the students come back, but I don't think I would be back to find out.",negative,en

opened by the same people who do sugar daddy's and dos gringos, this place has all the sexiness and allure of a Trails commercial. You know? I was half expecting to turn a corner to see a neon colored bikini-clad bleached blonde on top of a motor boat. well, they've updated the look of the cage-trapped go-go dancers to mini panties with knee-high dragon rider boots with fuzzy muppet skins adorning them.

the vids of drunken lounge-goers (a la daddy's and now dos) playing in tiny screens on the walls in hallways and behind bars in tact, interspersed with footage of seriously hagard looking chics doing ""sexy"" things like sucking on lollipops, cherries, winking (yes, she was winking right at you, wasn't she? inviting you in to her red-drenched lair to bask in the glow of a alcohol doused club circa 1992).

i'm not sure what the DRESS CODE we were so violently and largely reminded of in line, but the girl in front of me had on an oversized T-shirt, baggy jeans and flip flops (?) and they took her $5 and let her in no problem. i also saw a girl dressed exactly like peggy bundy...no joke, spandex black calf leggings, long spandwex shirt in orange, heels and a giant boob belt. it was so incredible i took a picture. she was not impressed with my observation, so i had to sneak the photo.

anyway.... take it for what it is, a club owned by dos gringos guys on mill ave.",negative,en
4,Just happened to be in the neighborhood when we saw this BBQ place.  The pulled pork and beef did not disappoint.  The sandwiches can be called 'hardy' portions on large buns.

The drinks are amazing- every last one of them- but the margaritas are the best I've ever had.  They tasted like a fresh squeeze of sunshine that makes me happy inside.  Margarita Mondays- $4 margs AND free food?  Happy hours are amazing.  New Year's Eve last year was amazing.  The 1 year anniversary party was amazing.

2,"This place is a bit scary.  (And since it is a Chinese restaurant, that means a little more than scary).  It's dark, (even though its been remodeled at least once since it has changed owners a few times).  It serves mostly Cantonese based cuisine although most of the waitstaff tend to speak Mandarin.  I'm actually Chinese and notice these things.  There is some live seafood.  I usually go here for lunch when we have a crowd.  It is inexpesive and fairly quick to get in and out.

4,"Sadly, my mom fell down a wet grassy hill walking her dog on Monday night and broke her ankle in two places. Ouch! She was rushed to Scottsdale Healthcare North in an ambulance and texted me on the way to alert me of her injury. Let's just say I hopped in the car without blinking and drove up to Scottsdale from Tucson as quickly and safely as possible. 

When I first arrived at the hospital she was in a very small room, directly off of the ER waiting room. Seriously, I thought  this was a closet, no joke! Jay, the RN, came in several times to check her blood pressure, take her to get x-rays, etc. You know....the typical hospital drill when you break your ankle! Anyhoo, he was so kind, gentle and had my mom in stitches (no pun intended - HA!) with his witty jokes. I could tell my mom thoroughly enjoyed his company and care. He was so wonderful and really helped take the pressure off of what was going to happen next....surgery! 

Shout out to Jay...You are awesome and thank you so much for going above and beyond to take such great care of my mom!

After five LONG hours of being in the ER, my mom was moved to her own room on the Orthopedic floor...FINALLY! (Side note, all rooms at Scottsdale Healthcare North are single room occupancy. This is such a fabulous accommodation!!! That means no fighting over the remote or loud snores coming from the other patient.....YAY for mom!)

At this point I knew this was going to be a long night and an extensive journey. We arrived at her room (on the 5h Floor) and were pleasantly surprised by the immediate welcoming of the evening nurses. They quickly got her settled into her room and made sure she was comfy. The room was small but super clean so no complaints there. 

A little while later we were told that my mom was going to have surgery sometime in the early morning but didn't have a confirmed time. Let's just say we both too tired to care because by now it was going on 2AM! 

I left the hospital and headed to my mom's house for a few hours of sleep before I returned in the morning for her pending surgery. Got there around 8ish and still no surgery time. Ok, at this point my only complaint was the waiting and the unidentified time of her surgery. This seriously went on all day until finally at 6pm she was wheeled down to pre-op. Again, more waiting as the anesthesiologist had a crisis situation with another patient. At this time I was fortunate enough to meet Dr. Nelson who was performing the surgery on her ankle. My impression of Dr. Nelson was that he was very warm, compassionate and informative. He asked for my phone number and said he would call me directly after mom's surgery with an update.....and he did! 

An hour or so later my mom arrived back at her room from recovery. All went well and it was time for sleep. I returned the following day (Wednesday) and waited her release. Ugh, more waiting.  My mom was finally released Wednesday evening around 8pm with no problems or issues. YAY, we are going home. 

Overall, the experience at Scottsdale Healthcare North was pleasant and satisfying and I'm so thankful for their excellent and professional care with my mom! The doctors, nurses, physical therapists and aids were amazing, caring and extremely helpful. You can really tell these people are passionate about their job. Fabulous job Scottsdale Healthcare North!!! 

Oh, one more thing.....

3,"Jason B. and I decided to try this place on Saturday night. I looked at the menu online and though the food sounded really interesting.

We started with the Artichoke Croquettes, and the Calamari as well. We were disappointed in the Artichoke Croquettes, you get 4 half Artichokes fried with alternating Marinara and this white sauce. The only thing that was good about this dish was the white sauce, which we used to dip the Calamari in. The Calamari was your average calamari, nothing special! 

I ordered a the 19th Street Burger, which was cooked perfectly and came with a spicy sauce, not sure if the sauce was for the Onion Rings, but it was great of the Burger.

1,"After stepping off the plane hungry, I looked around the terminal for food as I walked to the next gate. ""Wait a minute, I'm in Arizona. I should get some southwestern style food or mexican food. Is that a burrito place? Surely it can't be bad."" I ordered a #1, standard burrito. I take a bite. And another. ""Not bad I thought."" Then I took another bite. And promptly spit it out.

The cheddar cheese in my burrito was moldy. And no, I'm sure it wasn't blue cheese. It was even obvious visually. After pointing the cheese out to the manager, she brushed it off as ""the bag was just opened, it's not possible"" even after showing the obvious mold. People around me started looking uncomfortable. Someone muttered ""wow"" and stepped out of the line.

The best part? I wasn't even offered a refund or a new burrito, or an apology for the moldy burrito. Are you kidding me?",negative,en

You're within walking distance to The Mint, Dollhouse, Smashboxx, and the Pussycat Lounge. 

If I didn't live a $40 cab ride away (one-way) I'd come here way more often. 

Lots of huge flat panel tvs and plenty of seating. It gets packed on weekends but the place is pretty big so it never feels overwhelmingly crowded.

As an Arizona native and a downtown local I root for cool interesting places downtown. I wanted to love this place. The 1st time we tried the Duce I was extremely let down by the customer service.

However I decided to give them a second shot. Everyone has a rough night.

For me, Chipotle is one of those places you go to when you want something to eat from critters that have been decently treated while giving their life for your enjoyment.  And the food is ok too.  The guacamole is always fresh, the burrito's are big and there are lot's of add-ins.  Just don't expect any gustatory excitation, it's pretty basic, non-threatening, and I think I heard somebody refer to it as gabacho mexican food.  I think that pretty well sums it up.  However, a big plus is that the iced tea is always fresh and all-you-can-drink :-)",neutral,en
3,"I had business downtown this morning, so I stopped in here for lunch, right around the corner.  I used to go to OSF in Newport Beach, CA way back in the '70s, & I was somewhat amazed that they are still around & that there's one in Phoenix!

Stepping inside, this is the most junked-up restaurant I've ever been to!!!  Ok, except maybe Bahooka Ribs & Grog!*  It's a big place, with soft lighting inside, & rooms all over the place stuffed with tons of furniture, barrels, & so on, cluttering up every one of them!  It's all on purpose, of course, & my booth in the midst of all this craziness was actually completely ok.  (The floor elevation is up & down all over the place, too!) 

Ok, so for my first time (in about 35 years!) I just ordered the ""Pasta Classics - Rich Meat Sauce"", which is their way of saying, ""Spaghetti.""

Some good things:

*  I started with a cup of coffee, & it was excellent!

*  Pretty soon came a mixed lettuce salad, which was simple, but the Ranch Dressing was really tasty!

*  The next thing to hit the table was a little loaf about three by eight inches of hot Sourdough bread, with a cup of whipped garlic butter, all on a breadboard with a suitable knife for cutting it.  It was great!!

A couple of less wonderful things:

*  Some girl (from the kitchen?) brought my spaghetti before I was finished with my salad.

*  I thought the spaghetti sauce was ok, but not great.

Bottom line:  They give you plenty to eat here.  My meal included the beverage, salad (or soup), the hot bread, entree, & dessert.  It was nice & filling, & a good value at $9.99 for everything.    :-)

2,"Vegan Mexican with a urban funk to it. Should it work?  I dont know. Did it work?  Not really.

We walked in, it was empty quiet and after 20 seconds a surprised guy walked in and greets us. We take out seat on the purple booths and browse the menu while we sip watermelon water. Things got a bit stranger from there.

The menu had many interesting options, but each one we tried to order we found out that the didn't have chips, mushrooms or chorizo, key ingredients in many of the things on the menu. We had to just ask what can we order.

We ordered and waited, as the sun set it became quite dark as no one had turned on the lights. Another customer walked in but the waiter was busy working as a cook. It became even darker as we waited. The other customer finally was given a menu and the lights were turned on, however it was still pretty dark. 

Our tacos came, they were a bit small we each had 2.5 tacos I assume the 1/2 a taco to make up for the lack of chips on the side.

The tacos them selves were good, nice flavors crunch etc. for $8-$9 they should be good.  However the other problem sunk in as we were leaving, we were still hungry and after $21 and 45 min we were less than happy.

The next day they had posted a photo to Facebook, not about their food, or a special but look how how our waiter/cook is.   

So I guess if you want to look at toned male waiter this is your spot. Otherwise there are many kinks that need to be worked out.",negative,en
1,"Can someone please tell me why people go here???

Went to breakfast with Deb L, and she had a Living Social deal or one of those deal thingies. The place was packed, probably because it's a holiday week.

That doesn't excuse the EXTREMELY poor service. We sat down and waited. And waited. Servers walked by every few moments, nobody stopped to fill our water glasses or take our order. Finally, we both said something to a girl who walked by. She seems mystified that there was a job to do. With that many people working, getting a cup of coffee shouldn't take 15 minutes. Yes. 15 freaking minutes.

Food? Mediocre at best. I got the traditional eggs benedict with home fries. The only saving grace with the amount of ham on it. The English muffin didn't seem to be toasted. The eggs were *ok* but nothing great. The home fries? My 9-year old niece could do a better job. My burps right now aren't even good enough to brag about.

I'm sure if the service had been better, I wouldn't be so miserable right now. My food coma isn't satisfying. I will *never* go here again. Ever. I felt stupid leaving a tip, it was THAT bad.

I didn't dig the guacamole-too much salt, but loved, loved, loved the chips that came with it. The place is quite spacious and modern with featured art on the walls. I went for dinner so the lighting was minimal giving the place a sexy, urban feel to it. The kind of lighting that makes you wonder if the people are really this good looking? Or is the lighting really just this good??? 

The carne asada beef tacos were divine. Really moist and succulent with just enough spice to make your taste buds tingle. Two is hardly enough, so we also tried the fish tacos and well, I could smell the fishiness from across the table which makes me a little uncomfortable. I did try it, though and it was okay. Not too fond of anything that tastes or smells too fishy. Reminds me of unsanitized, dirty, dirty girls. (Haha, had to throw in a visual for you all!)

My favorite plate was the ensalada cortada. I loved all the ingredients mixed in together, especially the corn nuts. Genius idea! 

For drinks, I had the la sangria. Fruity, refreshing, and light tasting. It was really good, but I passed it on to my date in hopes of taking advantage of him later on. Almost worked, but when we got to the normally secluded rooftop @ the Clarendon hotel, they were hosting a social gathering of some sort with lots of people. Damn. Should've drank my sangria.

Their pizzas are light and tasty.  They looked like too much when they arrived, but they turned out to be the just the base we needed to get through a heavy night of drinking. The reclining booths took a second to get used to, but they just added to the laid back atmosphere once we mastered them.

OK, two friends go the tiniest 'tinis that didn't seem like much of a value, so its probably not the place for hard core drinking (I know, but these are the things I look for)  But for a relaxing cool place to start your evening off, I can still give it the thumbs up.",positive,en

My party of four had an excellent time celebrating a birthday.  Two had the short ribs.  Tender to a fault, served with delicious Bar-B-Que sauce and pecan grits.  One had the fillet with a spicy aioli and delicious potatoes.
My meal was a huge pork chop, stuffed with Maytag bleu on a ancho bread pudding.  

For an app I split the chop salad.  It deserves special mention and I do recommend it, but it is not a sustaining salad, more of a amuse-bouche.  For dessert we split the peanut-butter cheese cake, delicious.

The beverages deserve some mention.  The wine list is this restaurants' only fault, it is tooooo long.  There is a smaller, delicious by-the-glass selection.  The beer selection is well crafted.  I had two of my favorite beers, Dogfishhead Chicory Stout, something I had only had by bottle, wonderful.

I normally don't like high-priced eateries b/c there is often a lack of creativity, Cowboy Ciao doesn't disappoint.  Recommended over any Capital Griller or Flemmingsery for creativity and value for dollar.",positive,en

On a side note: I once met this old guy who said he brought Janis Joplin to this store to buy panties when she did a show here.

We ate out on the beautiful porch of this amazing house and although we don't drink, we were welcomed and enjoyed the experience. I asked the waiter for his dinner suggestion and went with it (fish and chips), my husband ordered the shepherds pie. Both were quite delicious. I even took the time to use the restroom and to see the inside of the restaurant and enjoyed the ambiance throughout the pub. 
I will definitely be back with friends to enjoy again.",positive,en

4,"I have been to this place twice so far.  The first time I had no idea what to expect since I never heard of it before.  I honestly have no idea what to compare it to but I guess the closest thing is Texas Road House judging by the reviews here on Yelp.  Anyway, I know its not the classiest joint with the best food, but anything is worth a fair shot.  The first time my wife and I went we were in the area doing some shopping and just wanted something quick and casual for dinner.  We didn't expect anything great but to be honest our expectations were exceeded.

The happy hour is pretty good.  $3 pints and 2 for 1 cocktails/wine.  Both times we went we ordered a 2 for 1 drink which would have been ok if they didn't charge too much for the first one.  I mean $5 for a small glass of Yellow Tail?  They are giving you 2 though so I can't complain too much I guess.

The thing we love about this place is the 2 meals for $13.99 special they have going on.  There are some pretty good options if you stay away from the fried stuff.  So far we have had the chop steak, steak and the salmon.  They are all very good and decently sized.  They prepare them however you want (sauce on the side, etc.) and everything comes with 2 sides.  There are 10 or so sides to choose from.  I get a side salad and some grilled onions or mushrooms to go with whatever meat I am having and they are always very good.  My wife always gets some sort of grilled vegetable and they are good as well. 

The service is very fast and friendly and the food always comes out pretty quick.  Oh yeah, and I also am a fan of their peanuts as well as the rolls that you get to start.",positive,en
5,"I just got back from an Arizona spring training vacation, and one of the highlights was definitely the Desert Botanical Gardens.  We came really close to skipping on a visit altogether because it was 5:00pm, but decided to give it a shot...it was worth it!  I was a little disappointed that the Butterfly Pavillion had closed for the day at 5:00pm, and several walking areas were being used for weddings/receptions (who could blame these people??) but still got to see a lot of beautiful desert plants and wildlife.  We managed to get in for free, not sure if it was because of the time of the day or all the people just walking in for the weddings though, which totally made the park that much more fun.  I am not sure I would have gotten as much enjoyment out of it if I'd had to pay $5 to get in...

The little desert rat-sqirrels, and rabbits were totally fun to try to find hiding in the many different plants and burrows.  I felt like a little kid ooh-ing and ah-ing at the different varieties of cacti and desert wildflowers, and have to give this place the ultimate rating .  If you're ever in Arizona, please give this place a try, it's very well put together and a beautiful site to see.",positive,en

Told owner I was unhappy and she said that a kid mani/pedii was 35 minutes then later 35 to 45 minutes. Tiffany never let it dry between coats so when she sat her under the light she told her only 5 more minutes and I stopped her. She said only the under coats will be wet and the top will be dry. I told her Really because you never even let it dry between coats.  She said not 4 coat.

1,"""No.""  

If you ask me about eating at Papaya Thai, that is what I will say. 

0 stars for the single kinda scattered and scruffy staffperson.  

0 stars for the cook who cannot prepare an offering from the menu as the menu describes it.

In this case, I was down to two remaining untried Thai restaurants within quick reach of the Valley Metro Limo, and both in Tempe.  The other half was in Tampa, and since he does not care much for Thai, I get the chance to try one.  

The limo arrived at Southern and Mill at 5:17 PM, and connected me with another limo at Broadway. With traffic, getting to McClintock took nearly 15 minutes.  On exiting the limo, 5:50 PM, I walked back about half a block to the restaurant.

On entering the restaurant, I picked up a menu and rang the bell and a somewhat harried staff person came to greet me.  He asked me where I wanted to sit, at a table with 1 bench looking directly into the side of a huge fish tank...or the next table, which would leave no buffer between myself and the only other table seated in the restaurant.  

There are at least 120 seats in this restaurant.  Why so fiercely contain people in the first three tables close to the door?  You must get your business in fits and hurries and keeping only the 3 tables active is working for you?  Then again, your telling me you are the only staffperson does not surprise me.  The Help Wanted sign on the door was more than an indication that Help is NEEDED!

When I was seated, staffperson offered to bring water.  The phone rang and he was off, as he offered another version of ""I am the only staffperson here...""  I looked at the menu and made my decision. In the menu, there is a $2 charge listed for sharing.  This goes against everything Thai I have ever known.  The traditional Thai meal has everyone enjoying some of each dish served.  Because of my proximity to the fish tank, I was quite up close and personal with the fish. The water probably isn't filthy, but the plexiglass tank is not helping the perception. 

6 PM, as the cellphone chime reminds me of the passing of an hour.  I am waiting for water and a staffperson who can take my order. 6:01, the staffperson comes, bearing a pitcher of water and a (My eyes are rolling in opposite directions because I am either overworked or stoned) smile.  He filled up my glass and asked if I was ready to order.  I replied that I was and ordered Som Tom, the Thai name for the green papaya salad. Staffperson replied that he did not know the Thai names for the menu items.  The phone rang again.

Staffperson's attention was no longer on me.  The phone, his Pavlovian stimuli, had taken him away.  I asked if he had heard me.  He replied that he needed to go answer the phone.  He asked if I minded waiting, as he was the only staffperson.  I said I would wait.  Off he went, in pursuit of electronic interaction.  

6:10 PM, staffperson returns, apologizing for the telephone delay and asking about my order.  I ordered the papaya salad without the green beans and steamed rice on the side.  Staffperson took the order and went to the kitchen.  The phone rang as he left the table,  his pace quickening as he approached the phone.  

6:18 PM, the door opens and 2 potential patrons enter.  The bell rings and staffperson rushes to the waitstand to greet 2 new patrons.  

6:20 PM, staffperson returns. He brings the salad and a bowl of rice.  The salad that appears has some of the traditional salad ingredients along with ingredients that have no business being in the salad.  Som Tom does not have cucumber, shredded lettuce or cilantro.  On sending back the initial preparation, staffperson returned with the original preparation, advising the chef stated ""This is a traditional Thai presentation of the dish"".  I sent the order back, citing the inconsistencies and asking for a new presentation.

6:25 pm.  As I empty my water glass, the salad I received previously is returned, minus the cucumber.  In asking staffperson if this is a new presentation or if it is an attempt to correct the original, he replied that he did not know.  I stood and left.  While the advertisement on the window of the establishment says they have ""The Best Curry in the Valley"",   they will get no second chance to prove it to me.  For all the phone activity, there was no one who came to pick up a carry-out order.  Between this and the somewhat glazed staffperson, I have to wonder if this place is not a front for a drug business.",negative,en
4,"I went to Saba's feeling a little scared.  Fast food Greek in a strip mall?  This could go one of two ways...surprisingly good or health code violation bad.  

I am very glad to say it didn't end being the latter.  In fact, the food here was pretty damn good.  I did expect Saba's to be an order at the counter joint, so I was a little disappointed to see it was actually a tiny restaurant.  I like my Greek fast and cheap, okay?  But I got over it, got a table and began the interminable wait for our server to stop chatting with other diners and take our order.

The menu has all the normal Greek items, including falafel- little fried balls of joy I might add- gyros, vegetarian platters, spanakopita and dolmas.  Prices for the sandwiches and gyros are pretty cheap, but when you venture into the platter territory, you're going to pay for it. Platters start around $10 and go up.  I ordered the falafel, of course, and so did my boyfriend.  The pita sandwiches don't come with any sides, so we ordered a basket of fries to go along with our meal.

The dcor was pretty cool with big pictures of Greece all over the walls and the classic Greek music piped in.  Unfortunately, not even the Greek music could mask the hideous, loud tool of a diner that was sitting at the table in front of me. He was one of those idiots that has to talk so loud, even the half-deaf cook in the kitchen can hear him.  He was so loud I felt like I should respond to his questions.  Hey moron- saying things like ""I like it loose, like my women,"" is just not funny.

Anyways, when we finally got our food, it was really good.  The falafel pita and the fries were tasty, but our server sucked.  He obviously knew the loud tool, and kept chatting with him while we waited for our check.  That was a little annoying, but overall, Saba's is a good choice for a quick Greek meal.",positive,en

5,"Please give this place a try when you're making your next stop at Pita Jungle. This restaurant seems to be very underrated and overlooked. We went on a Wednesday night around 7:30pm and it was empty while Pita Jungle was packed. Just the two of us on the patio, which was very nice. The interior and atmosphere are great. Nice tables & chairs, candles, shelves with wine bottles and art, and a very nice bar.

An Iranian family owns the restaurant and cooks everything themselves. That's the first sign of a high-quality establishment. They were incredibly nice to us and brought us whatever we needed. They gave us some good suggestions, like their Iced Black Tea, which is fantastic. It has a few other elements to it including Lavender. They brought us extra pita when we ordered some appetizers as well without us even asking.

For our appetizers, we tried the hummus and the tabooli. The hummus was very creamy but a little plain. We wished there was more flavor or spice to it. Not a big deal. That was the only part of our meal that was not 5 stars, but 4 stars. The tabooli....ridiculous. I've never been a fan of tabooli. It usually has too much parsley. But their version was balanced perfectly.

For an entree, I tried the Chicken Shawarma and we split a side of Basmati rice with saffron. A huge plate of rice with great seasoning. The saffron and olive oil gave the fluffy rice great texture. The Shawarma was fresh and delicious. The chicken was cooked and seasoned nicely.

For dessert, we tried the Persian vanilla ice cream with rose water and saffron as well as the Baghlava. The ice cream was some of the best we've had. Great flavor. The Baghlava was a great complement to the ice cream. A nice sweetness from the honey and the flaky dough was great.

So in summary, great atmosphere, great owners, out-of-this-world food, and very affordable. Everything we had came to about $32. We will return many times in the future because their menu is very promising. Just wish their name fit the type of place that it is. The current name makes it sound like just another Middle Eastern restaurant, which it definitely is not.",positive,en

About 10am is when it really got packed, just about when we got done. I ordered the chicken and waffles and i really liked it. I asked for some butter for my waffle because it didnt come with any and it made the dish perfect for me. The chicken had great flavor and when you take a bite with the waffle and butter and the syrup, heaven. I tried some bites without the butter and it wasnt even close to be the same for me. 
My grandma got some omellete and she gave me some because she knew she wouldnt finish it and i would order that also. The omelletes are pretty good size but my wifes dish, my sons and mine where not that much food especially for $9.

2,"I've known my way around Sky Harbor Airport since I was 4 years old and Terminal 1 was an actual terminal. In the time since then, their attempts to improve the airport, transportation and parking, and terminals have made it extremely confusing. Get in the wrong lane and you'll end up in the parking garage, when all you wanted was to drop off someone at the Departures curb. 

Terminal 2 remains the most accessible, with a parking lot located across the street and few airlines stationed there. Because only a couple airlines now use this terminal, security is a breeze. However, it's the oldest terminal, smells bad (like rotten pizza) and doesn't appear clean. 

Terminal 3 a little more of a hassle, although they have a parking garage attached to the terminal allowing you to enter any level through the elevator. More airlines use this terminal and it's much smaller than Terminal 4, making it easier to navigate.

Oh, Terminal 4. You're so nice, new and clean. You have access to great restaurants like Flo's Shanghai Cafe, Einstein's, Quizno's and more. I love Taberna del Tequila for a drink just prior to my flight inside security access (I don't like to fly, I prefer a bloody mary prior to boarding). You have tons of shops from Borders Books to local AZ tourist junk. I would like to love you, but you are just a mess. It's way to difficult to navigate your lanes to get where you're going, pick up and drop off is dangerous due to the people who pull away from the curb into lanes without looking, and security is painful- not only is there always a LONG line, but TSA agents regularly yell at people to ""pay attention!"" I dread flying out of Terminal 4 because I have to leave extra early for all the BS.

We went for dinner around 8:00 and it took way too long to get seated in the half empty restaurant. We were seated next to a family that must have been friends or family with one server, as she was constantly at their table. She was there while we were waiting and obviously saw us before finally showing us to a table.  Our server was a guy that must have been new, as he seemed very nervous and didn't know the menu.  

So we ordered the sushi sampler for me and the Korean beef and a veggie roll for her. I got the sushi, but not the salad and soup that it comes with. The veggie roll turned into an egg roll.

3,"Came for a friend's birthday and really was not that impressed. First of all, it took us a while to find parking as this place only has street parking and a few spots in back. On Saturday if you are there before 7pm, all alcohol was 1/2 off and some appetizers were on special. We ate dinner there and the menu was very limited. The food was okay, but our burgers were over cooked. The service was slow and it took us a while to get our check. I'd go to hang out again and have a few drinks, but I wouldn't suggest making this your regular hang out.",neutral,en

1,"One star is far more than they deserve.  The owner of the property spent an excessive amount of time barking out reminders of hotel policy, was rude to guests and his staff.  The stay here felt more like being in prison with the warden constantly in your face.  People in the group that stayed were locked out of the room by management, forced to pay made up fines.

4,"Neiman Marcus is a great addition to my shopping go-to locations like Nordstrom, and well, Nordstrom. I usually only shop at Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus, sometimes Saks.

Anyway. Neiman Marcus has impecable customer service but know that you kind of need to ""dress up"" to shop here. At least I feel uncomfortable if I come in in yoga gear. The selection is a nice compliment to Nordstrom -- much more tailored and designer specific. My boyfriend loves their men's section. 

I love their selection of Chanel handbags and other great purses. Plus, the layout of the store is just luxurious and calming. They don't carry MAC here but I love the Chanel, Christian Dior, and Laura Mercier counters. 

My ONLY complaint is their hours. Ugh. They close at 7 Monday through Saturday and 5 on Sunday. It's an hour earlier than the rest Scottsdale Fashion Square so there have been many times where I've trekked from Nordstrom to Neimans only to find they are closed. 

If you don't want to go through the mall there is complimentary valet at Neimans. You can park in their private lot but it's on a hill and narrow so if I'm feeling rushed I just valet....but I'm also not the best at parking.

NOTE: the only credit card they accept is AMEX. Otherwise it's cash or check. That's right, no Visa, no Mastercard",positive,en

We sat at the bar and ordered glasses of Wine and some Oysters.  The bar was packed, but we were able to comfortably enjoy our food and have a conversation.  The food was OK.  The Wine was the house Zinfandel, which was *eh*....but I didn't like the call options, so whatever.....now I know not to order Wine here.

We ordered drinks first along with a serving of Guacamole. Nice way to start off lunch! My wife ordered the Dilla Lunch while I ordered the Grande Burrito Lunch special. Both item arrived on a very hot plate-wonderful! Whenever we are dining at another Restaurant, a hot plate is always expected but all too often the hot plate fails to appear.

Our lunch stay hot until the last bite due to the hot plate service. Everything was great with the meal and no requested drink refills-always a sign of great service!

Both restrooms were very clean and serviced many times during the day. We highly recommend Abuelo's for a great lunch or dinner!",positive,en
4,"Let's rewind four years:

""You've never been to Chino Bandido?""
""No, what is it?""
""How long have you lived here?""
""About eleven years, but a bunch of those years were when I was a toddler, and I just moved back from a few years in Flagstaff.""
""And you've never been to Chino?""
""NO. What is it?""
""Amazing.""
""Take me there.""
""Okay.""

Yet we never went.

On the drive home from the Children's Museum of Phoenix, I realized that I was hungry, on a budget, and Chino Bandido was not too far off of path.  I ran the plan by my father, checking to make sure that would be an appropriate Father's Day dinner.  I received a confused look and thumbs up.  He's not the most adventurous when it comes to dining experiences, but is generally a good sport.

If my friend and I had been on the ball, I could have been eating here for four years.  Granted, I rarely have business around 19th and Greenway, but I could have made Chino Bandido my business.

We both ate a perfectly reasonably sized and delicious dinner for less than $10.  Three cheers for Caribbean influenced burritos and homemade teriyaki sauce.

Stevey P mentioned the only reason I'm giving four instead of five stars: If the dining room weren't so disgusting that I had trouble eating in it, it would easily be a five star place.  Wipe down the counters and tables, and perhaps give it a new coat of paint, and I'll be completely thrilled.",positive,en
4,"While I am giving this restaurant four stars, I must start off by noting that the pizza here is mediocre.  If you want spectacular pizza in Phoenix, don't kid yourself that it's at I-17 and Thomas.  It's over at Pizzeria Bianco.

However, the other items on the dinner menu are worthy of a visit to the 'hood.   The Penne alla Vodka ($12.95) offers up pasta in tomato sauce with bacon, fresh basil cream and vodka.  It is an excellent starter to split with a dining companion and that's exactly what the BF and I do every time we visit this place.  The Cozze Posolipo mussels in garlic white wine sauce ($11.95) are also quite tasty as an appetizer.  The complimentary warm pizza dough they serve with an onion and olive topping is a nice touch.  For entrees, the Pollo Parmigiana ($14.95) is the classic breaded chicken breast with marinara, mozzarella and parmesan cheese served with penne.  The Lasagna della Casa with Bolognese sauce ($13.95) is very good, but the portion is a bit stingy for the price.  The BF often enjoys the Gamberi alla Pana ($15.95) that includes jumbo shrimp saut√©ed with mushrooms in a brandy cream sauce over a bed of fettuccine.  Please note that the brandy cream sauce is extremely rich.  Another tasty option is the Spaghetti con Salsiccia ($13.95) with mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and Italian sausage in marinara sauce with a touch of white wine.  The Cheese Ravioli ($13.95) is another great choice with the tomato cream sauce.  For dessert, be sure to order a Cannoli Siciliani ($5.95) as it's the very best I have had in Phoenix.  The Tiramisu ($5.95) is good as well.

The bad news is that this place is no longer BYOB.  For whatever reason, the management decided that a restaurant that seats no more than 20 needed a full liquor license.  I really hope that the investment in that spendy license doesn't lead to the undoing of this place.  Given that they don't even have a bar area and I almost never see anyone order a mixed drink, I think staying BYOB might have been a better choice for this neighborhood joint.

The service at this place is also part of the show.  The waiter may well be manic as he will either be way up or way down for your visit.  The d√©cor here is pleasant enough given the location of this tiny restaurant in a modest strip mall.  If you happen to need a trip to the restroom, you will get the chance to traipse through the kitchen.

All in all, Pizza A Metro is ironically a great option for everything but pizza.",positive,en
3,"I have been to the original Vig and was happy to see that they were opening the Vig Uptown within walking distance of mi casa.  So far, I've only been able to schlep over on weekends for brunch.  I'll say that the food is good, but the service on my last trip was pretty lacking.  At one point, my BF & I sat for nearly 20 minutes between the coffee delivery and the actual order taking.

1,"Yikes, reading other reviews I realize my bad experience wasn't unique. As a server I make a very laid back customer. I like pretty much everything I eat and don't require a lot of attention from the waiter. 

La Piccola Cucina would benefit from just one extra person in the front of the house. Our guy, though adorable and friendly, was too busy to refill our drinks and to remember to bring our appetizer (though charged us for it). The ahi tuna (highly recommended over the other fish options he said) was so overcooked it was the color and consistency of chicken. Like other reviewers mentioned, he was frantic and made that clear to every customer. At one point I even saw him in the kitchen cooking - they need another person! 

I left super stressed out from the experience, which is very, very unusual for me. You can either have bad service or bad food, but not both.",negative,en
4,"NEEDS A CUSTOMER FACING DISPLAY FOR THEIR POINT OF SALE SYSTEM. The staff here is WONDERFUL, and the OWNER IS ALWAYS HERE, yes that's right, if you come here often, you have the pleasure of meeting Lenny himself.

But one major flaw is that they need a display on their point of sale system showing you what you have ordered before you pay (just like their Glendale location), because I have had my order messed up more than quite a few times here, usually they forget my extra french fries, or place everything in the world on my cheese burger, when I only wanted the cheese, meat, and bun.

Other than that, I don't really have anything negative to say about this place. I love the staff, and if the right person is at the register, they remember my order and the negative points I have made above is negated.",positive,en

WITH THE HOUSE MARGARITAS OF COURSE!! Hands down THE best house margarita I have EVER had. No syrups or mixes, this is straight tequila and lime juice baby, very refreshing and delicious! And for 4 bucks on a Monday evening, how can you go wrong?

Their specials are all very good: Margarita Monday (as mentioned) with half price Apps, and Taco Tuesday with their dollar tacos and $2 tecate's...HELL YA. 

They have a great range of tacos here and all are pretty delicious. Try the nachos with Al Pastor on them too, delicioso! Their chips and salsas also kick ass.

I had the Salmon BLT.  I did not even have to ask the friendly order taker to make the bacon crisp or the salmon to be slightly charred.  Everything about this wonderful sandwhich was perfect.  To be honest, I would switch out the the shredded iceberg lettuce for spinach leaves.  Still the sandwhich was terrific with it's nice proportion and the aioli sauce to bring it all together.

My dining comanion had the spinach and sirloin salad which was also completely finished at the end of the meal.  By the looks of the empty bowl it came in- it must have been really good!

It was a little hard to find, although we were not at all familiar with the area. We had the wings as an app. and used the Louisiana gold hot sauce, something new to us that we are having trouble finding in Ohio since we fell in love with it there. The gumbo was outstanding, and even the alfredo pasta had a spice sprinkled on top for a Cajun style kick... it was unexpected, and awesome! Huge portions - that we both had plenty to take with us for a whole other left over meal. ... the prices were great, especially with the coupon (or actually the entertainment card that they punch for fine dining restaurants).

This buffet offers a large selection of food...hot entrees, made to order sushi, Mongolian BBQ, soup, fresh fruit and salad, and dessert.  I liked the fried rice, chow mein, broccoli beef, string beans, and this dish with tofu.  The egg drop soup was really good and the hot and sour soup was decent.  

For a Chinese buffet, they offered some quality desserts since some of their offerings probably came from Costco like the red velvet cake and cream puffs.  

Service was friendly and polite.  Our waitress did a great job with clearing our plates and offering to refill our hot tea.  (Hot tea was $1.60 per person, by the way.)

I'm a big fan of a good Italian Beef sandwich.  I was introduced to it when I lived in the Chicago area in 2001.  Since I've moved back to AZ, I am always in search of a good one.  Lately, on my way to Anaheim for a little family fun, I stop at Portillo's in Buena Park or Moreno Valley.  This is a must.  Needless to say this is what I compare Italian Beef sandwiches to.

The Italian Beef sandwich at Al's just did not compare.  Not only was the beef dry even though I got it wet, but it just tasted different.  It was definitely an unexpected taste for me.  The rest of the family agreed too.  The hype was there but did not deliver or meet my expectations for me.

To top it off, the service wasn't the best either.  It took a few times for the cashier to get the order right.  And even though the order was right they still managed to screw up one of the items we ordered.  Though they did rectify it.  And to top it off, we ordered a ""chopped"" salad.  The lettuce wasn't even chopped.  What?  Not chopped?  It's the little things.

We ended up leaving disappointed.  It was a bust for us and definitely not worth the trek from Chandler.",negative,en

Our waiter was very kind, didn't try to rush us, and gave us plenty of time to decide. 

We had a house salad, dirty chips, and an order of sliders. The house salad seemed a bit over priced for what it was, but the dirty chips were really good! The sliders were average, and well priced.

The sticky buns everyone raved up - did not come out as an appetizer or even after meal treat - oddly came out with our dinner so it was basically over looked.  The restaurant was not crowded yet we were sat at one of the few tables without a view.  My biggest problem was the flies.  They were everywhere and we were seated INSIDE the restaurant not on the patio.  When you go to an up-scale restaurant to celebrate a special occassion, who wants to be shooing flies away from their food.  It was really disgusting and distracting.  For the money we spent to eat here I felt ripped off.

1,This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but the service went way down hill.  The new owners hire lots of college students with tattoos everywhere as well as lots of piercings.  Seems like tattoos and too many piercings are a job requirement along with disrespect and a lack of desire.  The staff is what made this place the worst restaurant ever and doesnt seem to matter how often you let management know I just dont think they care.  Also in the past few years there is a growing number of homeless that sit out front begging for money.  They sit so close to the outside patio that you have them dining with you or at least it feels that way making you incredibly uncomfortable.  Our last visit we sat on the patio which was next to a bench just outside the restaurant where a few homeless were stationed.  One girl had a huge rat on her shoulder and it was beyond disgusting.

Since I enjoyed the chile-pistachio bread last week, I asked if I could have the commercially-made burger bun swapped out with the new-recipe chile-pecan bread.  No problem.  Ordered it medium, no pickles.  By the time I had thought to take photos of the burger (I was starving so I dug right in!), the scene was a mess!  From the very first slice, the longhorn cheddar-topped patty crumbled into many pieces- I kept wishing I had a spoon to scoop them up!  No matter, as it was still a wonderful meal- loved the smoked bacon, and the chipotle mayo worked well both as a burger condiment and as a dip for the wonderfully crisp and seasoned fries (see photos).

5,"I have no idea why I haven't dined or noshed during happy hour at this place more often, I've always had great service, great wine, and great food. There is no adequate excuse , but anyway, my third adventure here made me update my review to 5 stars because 5th and Wine has earned it.

The wines by the glass range from $8 - $11 unless you come in before 6pm then they are only $5! Those prices alone should make you want to come here for drinks with friends. The servers have always been cool with offering samples if you can't make up your own mind between two wines despite the recommendation from the server and your friend saying ""just pick one!"". Due to this fact, I've always had a glass that I have enjoyed, which is usually a Zinfandel. 

I have now had the pleasure of experiencing all of their different types of bruschetta. My top two favorites are the Prosciutto, Mascarpone, Figs, and Tomato Jam which has a great combination of salty and sweet, and the Apples, Brie, and Fig Jam one which is on the sweeter side, but not overwhelming because the bread and the tart granny smith apple slices help balance out the flavor. The Chopped Salad is very light and refreshing option to accompany the brushcetta appetizer. 5th and Wine is also a restaurant so other food options are available, I have sampled the Chicken and Pesto Pasta which has a delicious cream sauce and their Mac & Cheese which is super rich with the two types of melted cheese, but both items are delicious.

The atmosphere is great whether you are sitting inside or outside. The lighting is soft, giving more of an intimate feel, yet this place still remains simple and casual, which I love. The outside patio is great, it is a courtyard that offers peeks into store windows while remaining private from the traffic of Old Town. The times I have been here it has never been super crowded and I am able to just walk in and be seated right away. 5th and Wine still feels like a hidden gem and you must try it out!",positive,en

Let me first say that Happy Hour prices were outstanding!  I have to admit, I think my favorite Happy Hour spot, StingRay, has just been outdone!

The food was delicious!  All of it!  ALL...OF...IT!  From the cucumber salad to their famous appetizer, the mustard leaf wrap, it is flavorful and fresh.

The service was pretty good, but there was some confusion I think more than once, so it delayed the service a bit.  When I have to stop and say, ""Hey, where's my [fill in the blank], I know the service is lacking, although I would say not enough to keep me away!

4,"Little Chicago Pizza is the best thin-crust pizza I think I've ever had. The restaurant is small, as they probably do most of their business carry-out or delivery.  We did eat in one time, and someone came right out from the kitchen to serve us, even filling our water cups from the soda fountain that was perfectly accessible for us to do ourselves.  Anywhere else I'd have expected a snotty ""the water is right there"" rather than real service.  Everybody is very friendly, even when on the phone taking orders.  Price is comparable to any other pizza spot around, but the pizza itself, if you like thin-crust, is just awesome.

The decor is as previously described - you sort of time warp back to the 80's but it is clean and well loved by its owner.  They do have a lot of authentic menu items and a great kids meal, but the ramen was just not that good.  Its downfall was the broth.  Hubby got the salmon chirashi which was also not that fresh.

2,"I actually yelped this restaurant from my brunch table and my blackberry wouldn't post the review.  So, will try to capture the original intensity of the yelp.  I still love my blackberry and maintain it is better than iPhone, by the way!

Anyway, anyone who knows me well appreciates the importance of toast in my life.  When I moved to Phoenix to work for a catholic hospital, my best friend bought me a ""Jesus toast"" stamp which puts an imprint of the Mary which appears better when the bread is toasted.  I guess she wanted me to fit in.

So when I told my waiter I was having a ""bad toast experience"" and he blew me off, you can imagine the impact.  I ordered the oatmeal as well as the basket of toasted willow breads served with a variety of jellies, Nutella, honey etc.  My oatmeal came out with over-buttered, grilled bruschetta-style toast; that's it--a plate with a bowl of oatmeal and 3 pieces of bread.  I asked for flatware, then brown sugar and milk, then inquired about my basket of willow bread.  The waiter said, ""this is the toast that comes with your meal.  I reminded him of my order and he brought me some jam.  I decided to stop complaining (cus I had been making ridiculous requests like being served what I ordered and having utensils).  I put jam on the ""toast"" and it literally tasted like they had grilled it in bacon grease.  Meanwhile the table next to us (the only other occupied table in the restaurant at 10 am on a beautiful Sunday) was getting their cranberry walnut and sourdough bread, perfectly toasted with all the accompaniments.  I told the waiter I wanted toast like theirs and that mine tasted like pork (still a veggie after 25 years) and he said again, ""this is the toast that comes with your meal"".  My friend was getting embarrassed, so I gave it up and left.  How hard is it to bring a girl a new piece of bread?

Ok, now all the anger is stirred up... I must say that My florist is one of my fav weeknight spots and their pianist is first rate-amazing.  She truly plays from her soul and her personality shines through in her interpretations of classic songs.  I have been there since the ""toast experience"", but make my friend arrive first to look for the waiter with the ponytail!",negative,en
3,"No frills.  Nothing fancy.  Just some honest burritos and tacos.  Voted ""best taco"" by New Times a few years back (in the 90's).  Not sure I agree, but they consistently satisfy.  They make a hearty breakfast burrito too.  If you're looking for Sonoran or Tex-Mex or anything beyond what you might find at Filiberto's, try somewhere else.  The red burro combo is my personal favorite.  It's saucy (enchilada style) and just spicy enough.  Bottled beer available.",neutral,en
4,"My first experience with PCG was at a small, yet fantastic Yelp event.  I've been back twice and have been just as impressed.

The first time was for brunch, and I recommend the griddled corn cakes.  No, I just don't recommend them, I insist you have them.  Even if you are allergic to corn, take the plunge and try these...unless you might die, then stay away as that might be bad PR for PCG.  Topped with smoked ham (that's what I had), chicken, or bacon and served with maple syrup, it was beyond good.  I could eat this dish every day of my life.  The black beans were okay, but I do think the breakfast potatoes are nothing special and could be improved upon.  I was a big fan of a $4 mimosa, however!  Yep, you read that right...4 bucks!

Second visit for dinner, and I ordered the cedar planked salmon.  A generous piece of fish perfectly cooked and served with a delicious lemon aioli.  The accompanying roasted beets were not my thing, and the mashed potatoes were okay (maybe I'm picky about potatoes?)  I also tried a bit of my dining companion's beef tenderloin and it was butter-knife tender (that's what I cut it with).  Served with a stuffed potato and mushrooms, I believe, it will most likely be my next entree.  For dessert, we shared the Jack Daniel's croissant bread pudding.  We actually shared half, and I most generously took the other half to my husband who I left at home.  Although, I generally don't care for bread pudding, this is NOT your typical bread pudding and probably the best bread pudding you can imagine (other than that one recipe that uses a dozen Krispy Kreme doughnuts).

Although PCG is a little bit of a drive for me (outside my usual 5-mile maximum radius), I will happily make that drive and return again.",positive,en
2,"OK after hearing about this restaurant from a friend I decided to take the family out. First I must say that living in the valley for over 30 years I still and always will be a Haji Baba fan in Tempe Az. for life!(yelp them)

So, walk in and would agree that the ambiance was less than. Dinner tables were cheap and the table cloth was tacky. Oh almost forgot why is there a large mirror on the wall? Were given dinner menus by a impolite waitress who I suspected was surely going to be the owner. The first thing that hit was the prices! $$$ I kindly asked the waitress if I could just have a Gyro sandwich. The answer was NO! (rudely). Those are only available during lunch time! Ok, so next option was to gamble on a gyro plate priced at $14.95. We placed our order and waited. The food arrived on a timely manner. The food was hot and looked good. The tzatziki-sauce was a 10! Although the gyro meat was not to my tasting, it was ok for being real hungry. Eventually the waitress started warming up to us! :) 

PROBABLY WONT RETURN AGAIN.

Pros- Fresh food, Location

Cons-Couldn't get what I really wanted.(A gyro sandwich)

-No kids menu.

Go on Thursdays, if you can, when a designated tag color is just $1. I've purchased a lot of name brand clothing here for $1 per piece. You can also check out certain Saturdays when everything in the store is half price. I got a great mirror that matched the dresser in my guest bedroom for $12.50.

4,"While I don't like to hype places up (because really, how GOOD can any one place be) ...How good can one burger joint be over another, or how good can pizza be over another pizza place (when weighing the ones that are all generally Good in the Public Opinion).  Now the word around town is that The Grind is Sofa_King Great.  I will say about The Grind that when you're up for a Burger, this place hits the spot.  I've been here once before August 2010 (don't remember what burger I had but recall it was good) and the other night I had the Peppercorn Burger and it was as good as it gets.  I was starving and really hadn't eaten all day and that helped add to how much this hit the spot, but make no mistake, it was really good and I do enjoy this place for the atmosphere, service, and quality of food.  My friends wife got one of those healthy wraps and she liked it a lot.  The sweet potato fries (we ordered the half sweet potato and half regular fries) and they were good.

As for some other areas to review: The atmosphere is nice.  It's casual and not too dark and not too light inside.  (That's how I like it).  There's multiple flat panel TV's above the bar, so plenty of games on at any given time (That's also how I like it).  The service is fine (although based on some other reviews people have been so so satisfied about the service.  That's often going to be the case with most casual establishments - so sometimes it's good, and sometimes not to our satisfaction).  Such is Life!  Anyway, back on track here, the Wait staff and Bar staff have been worth the 20% tip both times.  No complaints by me about this place, however I do see some 2 and 3 star ratings on here.  

Where I will dock 1 star and sort of agree with Kristi D.  She mentioned the large photo of Sheriff Joe Arpaio on the wall (while I sense that Kristi doesn't care for Sheriff Joe, I'm neutral about him), but I agree about all the oversized photos of notable names in town who have dined in The Grind.  I'd much rather see real artwork or real photographs on the wall - and not photos of Sheriff Joe, Mark Grace (for those who don't know, he's a former baseball player), and the Mayor of Paradise Valley, all holding their burgers.  Who the hell cares about any of them and their burgers.  I think I'd be more ok with having these photos above me, but they are HUGE enlargements and a bit overkill.  And they are for sale and the proceeds go to some cause.  Look, I'm all for causes and shit, but I wouldn't spend my money on a 36 inch enlargement of these local ""notables"" holding a burger.  The whole concept is pretty stupid.  But hey, I'm generally uptight and been doing photography 20+ years and probly am just hating on the fact that my photos are hanging on the wall.
 
Side Note:  For those who might have previously had ""Liked"" The Grind on Facebook but no longer have their page as a Like, it's because they apparently had their group page hacked, so they had to start over.  I found this out when I Liked it the other day noticed there were only about 165 Like's, and certainly I knew this place was way more popular than that.  When I commented that, they commented back about it being hacked and starting the page over.

Their rindsroulade was very good, and the red cabbage and spaetzle were excellent. But the quality of the food was undercut by the poor service. It was bad enough that I wouldn't return, and certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. As others have noted, there was no-one to greet or seat us -- not even a sign saying ""seat yourself"". Our waitress took a LONG time to make it to our table to take our drink orders, and when she did, she was complaining about something and looked put-out in general. When my wife ordered a beer, the waitress told her that it would be more expensive because it wasn't available on tap. Now, that could be useful information, but the manner in which she told my wife was defiant rather than helpful. Believe me, we gave her no reason to be so sour --  it was clear that this particular waitress was clearly unhappy -- whether with her job or life, it's hard to say. It's too bad, really, because the food *was* good. But why would anyone want to eat at a restaurant whose workers are either nowhere to be found, or miserable? Not me.",negative,en

One item did impress me, and that was the complimentary appetizer that was comprised of tempura'd chips with perhaps a squid salad topping (?)  I should have just ordered another serving of this!  Instead, I tried an Ao Yasai (mixed gourmet greens with ginger) and a sushi roll w/ brown rice, the latter I thought was price-y considering the very small portion given.

2,"This is tough, because I REALLY wanted to like this place! What killed it for me? The lack of professionalism that was presented when my fiance and I came to look at this venue. I will admit that we were 10 minutes late to our appointment, however I do not think this warrants being treated like a herd of cattle.

First when I called the venue to make an appointment whoever picked up the line sounded as if they were in a rush and not even interested in making the appointment which was the first turn off. Upon arrival, we walked into another entrance thinking it was the main entrance, then we were re-directed by an employee to the adjacent door. As we walked out there was (I don't even remember her name), the wedding coordinator waiting. She quickly greeted us then had us sit down as she began to talk about the venue. 

Usually when you want to sell the venue you run, you'd think you would see someone with a little enthusiasm and fire explaining why their venue is so amazing. Well, we didn't get that from this individual. What did we get? A quick 10 minute spiel about what they do and the services provided and 3 wedding books shoved in our faces as examples then a quick 10 minute tour of the place. That's it, no effort, no emotion, no interest in wanting to get to 'know us' and get a feel for what kind of wedding we would like to have, just a quick, here is the place, goodbye. She was very snooty and acted as if she was not in the mood to showcase the venue.

So why two stars instead of zero? One star is for the venue itself. It is very chic, modern, yet elegant. The reception area is beautifully decorated and where the ceremony is held is beautiful as well! There are many ways one can decorate this place! The other star is the PRICE. This venue offers all inclusive packages at unbeatable prices. I mean an all inclusive package where they provide virtually everything for roughly 100 guests is $9495.00 taxes and gratuity included!!! That's a steal, trust me, I've looked into a TON of venues, you will not find an all inclusive price as cheap as this. 

Honestly, if my fiance and I were the only individuals funding our wedding, then we probably would have considered this place (more than likely, VEGAS). However, given the type of customer service that was displayed, we took our business elsewhere.",negative,en

That was a long time ago. 

When I was younger (and significantly poorer) Ikea was the one true way I could get semi-stylish home furnishings at a reasonable price. Many a room was filled with fine pre-fab furniture that was always just a wee bit small. 

It's funny how ones' tastes change. This weekend I ventured forth to Ikea in search of baby stuff. A good friend of mine is with child and wanted to check out what Ikea had to offer. 

Walking through the store I saw the same stuff I saw ten years ago, and while I could still see the appeal, I realized that it just wasn't as cool as I remembered. Ah well, at least I still have the memories (and the coffee table, end tables, TV stand and lamps). 

Ikea is still great if you have something specifically in mind. My friend found a bunch of excellent decorations for the soon-to-be-born babies room, all for insanely low prices. I bought a few pillows. Yes, this is what my life has become.

Decent place to eat, but not a value for what you pay for.",negative,en
3,"The pizza's OK, not anything to write home about.  I sat on the outdoor patio, which is on the main street, so while entertaining to watch all the people go by (and there's a wide variety), if you're table's right along the outside edge of the patio (which I wasn't), you may end up interacting with the transients coming by.  So, I got to observe everyone going by without having to interact with them, which was just fine by me, because I do like to people watch.",neutral,en
5,"This place confirms why ""hole in the wall"" places are the best places to get food. Its virtually impossible to find the place but once you smell the aroma of home-cooked Mexican food, you know that you're there. Usually there is a long line; however, their service is quick. With the combination of their swift service and decadently savory food, Rito's is a staple Mexican food stand that everyone has to visit when in Phoenix. I always have a green chilli burrito and haven't quite ventured out to other things on their menu, but I have never heard anything less than positive about what they have to offer.",positive,en

5,"Tried Roy's for the first time last night when we met some friends who rave about their Aloha Hour (Happy Hour).  Always avoided going because we tend to not like restaurant chains, but this place is a gem and exceeded our expectations.

The bar area is relatively small, but very classy.  We were able to have few drinks at the bar ($5 for beer, wine, and their signature cocktails) before we were able to get a table in the bar area for 5 people...thanks to Leah and the hostess staff (you guys are great).  Didn't have a bad drink -- loved the The Original Hawaiian martini was delish, as was the mojito, jalapeno margarita, mai tai, and wine.  A friend was sad the cucumber drink she liked was missing from the menu, but sounds like the menu changes often so diners/drinkers get a chance to try new concoctions throughout the year.  

For food, we tried most of the HH specials.  Everything was spot on -- excellent flavors and beautifully presented.  The tuna roll and tempura shrimp rolls were my favorites (sushi rolls), with the lobster pot-stickers being a close second.  Some friends ordered dinner...and were able to speak with Chef Bray about his recommendations for fish.  She ended up getting the Crab Dynamite Baked Barramundi, which was so yummy!  The happy rice on the side was great too.   My hubby got the Yellow Fin Ahi Poke -- something we have looked for since trying some fresh poke in Kona, HI last year.  I couldn't believe the flavors...eating poke in the AZ desert!  Its preparation with the Wasabi Cr√®me Fra√Æche made it a meal we will seek out again in the near future.  Ended our meal by sharing the chocolate souffle, which was a perfect ending to a great Friday night gathering.  

Definitely recommend Roy's for seafood that is excellently prepared.  Aloha Hour is a must.  Extra props to Matt, our waiter, and Leah on the hostess team for their accommodations and service.  We had a great night.",positive,en
5,"""If you buy half a duck, you don't get to pick which duck.""

I lived in China, mainly Guangdong, for three years, and all it really took was a look at this sign, along of course with all the wonderful roasted ducks and pork, to know I had come across a place with bona fides. 

Hope Kee has some of the very best Chinese food in town, in my opinion, and is worth the trip from wherever it is in the valley that you live. 

I don't know anywhere else in town you can get such good congee, which is actually called ""zhou"" or ""jook,"" and which is a soupy, delicious rice porridge.  

They're also one of the only places you can get dried scallop soup, which they do an excellent job of. 

Dried scallops, a specialty of HK/Guangdong, are one of the most delicious things in the world. 

Everything that they make is delicious, and sitting in there listening to the customers and staff talk in Chinese and Cantonese can really take you back to China, if you've had the pleasure of spending time there. Otherwise it's just about as close as you can get. 

If you want to eat some real Chinese food that is both delicious and approachable, and very reasonably priced, you can't beat Hope Kee. 

Get some soup or some congee, some clams with black bean sauce, some greens and some BBQ, and you'll see why China and Hope Kee are such hard places to stay away from. 

If you do decide to try your hand at duck-picking and buy a whole duck, fear not for wasted leftovers, because roasted duck makes for a very tasty soup.",positive,en
5,Was looking for a nice dinner place in Peoria to send my mom and step-dad for a birthday celebration.  The people at Flemings were wonderful.

4,"Given the high ratio of staff to customers, it took longer than expected to get acknowledged. However, my drink came out quickly, as did my food. The menu items all had cheesy names based on the Fox sportscasters, but that, along with the 24 TV's playing (you guessed it) sports, made it rather entertaining. The food quality was surprisingly good for an airport sports bar--burger was tasty, bacon was crispy but not burnt, and made with actual sharp cheddar cheese. 

Service was good too. Lorraine refilled my drink the instant it was empty, cleared the dishes and offered the check within a minute of pushing them away, and brought the receipt almost immediately. If I'd been rushing to catch a flight, I think I""d have been fine. Burger, fries, and unlimited Coke, plus tax and tip for just under $17; not too bad for an airport.

Then flash forward to the next day and if you're heating up second lunch (I like to eat) in the office micro and employees comment on the delicious smells, yeah you're doing a-ok! I was solo this time because Gabi M was home with baby Mess and I didn't think to call Jarred (sorry bud!). Eating alone certainly wasn't as much fun but it was delicious. Eggplant is a must. You just HAVE TO get it, done. In addition I also had a really yummy chicken dish with wide noodles, veggies, basil, and a spicy/sweet sauce. SO tasty. The portions are enormous, so don't balk at the prices. Grab two entrees, share with the group, take home leftovers...that simple ;).

Was walking around. Then the dog came up to us for no reason, and jumped on my puppy just started beating him up. The owner didn't even do nothing.. The dog was almost killing my puppy. I yelled at the dog tried to stop him. Then he attacted me. Bit me very bad on left hand. The owner  asked me where I was going I said west valley hospital. I was very scared. She said she would meet us @ the Hosiptal. I never saw her show up.. Those kind of Aggressive or angry dogs shouldn't be allowed out there. Yea go at your own risk. But people should 
not let angry or aggressive dogs out there. The owner didn't even say sorry or give me her name, nothing.  Shame on her. And her aggressive dog.

We started with the Freshie Rolls with warm Peanut Sauce and Lychee Martini. Nice, but not the best in town (Pure Sushi Bar has a to die for Lychee Lemon Drop).  

The entrees are huge and could easily be shared. We had the Kimow - hot and spicy clear noodles, chicken, broccoli, snow peas, sweet onion, Thai chili, garlic and sweet Thai Basil - Delicious!

To be fair, Thai is not one of my favorites, but we love to support local restaurants and this came highly recommended. Glad we tried it.

The macaroni and cheese is one of the best i have ever had and my brother who was visiting from Kansas almost O.D.'d on  the stuff.

We had their birthday parties there about 6 months ago.  Overall, I think the kids had fun. The only downside to the birthday parties is that you can't have a private party unless you do it afterhours, which is sort of late for young kids.   I think its $9 for an open session.  My only other complaint is the quality and price of the food.  I think its Sam's Club food.  They charge $2.00 for a not so great hot dog.  Also, I think they need to vacuum more often; the floor appeared to be pretty dirty.  They say they vacuum everyday, but I'm not so sure about that.",positive,en

Having said that, I recently gave it another shot and and went for the carne asada burrito.  Very, very good.  The cut of the beef is a little thicker than the usual Salazar's or Filiberto's burrito, but it was really good regardless.  Oh, and the beans in there were awesome, too.  It didn't have guacamole and I didn't notice till it was too late, but I'll be sure to get some in there next time.

Richard Cho not only has some of the best customer service skills I have ever seen (that guy has an amazing memory for names) but some of the most creative approaches to making Sushi in the valley.

The use of Macadamia nuts is brilliant and an amazing addition to many of the creative rolls that are available. The Spicy scallop roll is a go to for sure. They have (and I know this sounds stupid) the BEST California rolls in Arizona. As pedestrian as that roll is, The California roll is transformed in to a very dessert style treat when ordered at Sushi Eye. Seriously, do it.

3,"Being the B, L, and D (breakfast, lunch and dinner) restaurant of a major valley resort takes allot of versatility. From scrambling eggs to grilling a piece of meat the new Rico's American Grill at the Point Hilton Squaw Peak Resort shows that all this can be done and more on a daily basis. 

With two massive patios, a large bar and lounge area coupled with a fantastic selection of locally made beers on tap, just beckons you to try them all out. This is easily done by ordering up a Beer Flight ($7) which gets you 4 5oz glasses of their best brews, though this will be tough to chose, they're all good. Then you can order a capped 64oz growler ($20) to go! A growler is simply a large glass jug filled with your favorite beer, your choice. These are all the rage in other cities so I was excited to see Rico's making this offer. Id fill it with my latest favorite, Left Hand Milk Stout Sweet Stout. Think rich flavors of chocolate and coffee blended with milk sugars to give a sweet and creamy taste. 

In the large dining room you'll notice a wood fired oven. Unfortunately Rico's doesn't take full advantage of this, only offering a handful of menu items cooked in it including the BBQ Chicken Flatbread ($12). Covered with pulled chicken, red onions, Rico's BBQ sauce and mozzarella, this paired well with our beers though could have used a bit more salt, easily remedied. Another glimmer of what could be was the Wood Oven Baked Penne ($13). Several large meatballs, roasted tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and pesto ricotta cheese and al dente pasta made for a hearty satisfying meal. 

A bit lighter but bold with flavor, the Chopped Salad ($10, add grilled chicken $3) made with grilled corn, black beans, bacon, tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, and BBQ-ranch dressing was shaken, not stirred, literally. The salad is brought out in a large martini shaker, dressing added on the spot then shaken well. Kind of a neat twist on table-side salad service, what's old is new again. 

The Wicked Meatloaf ($15) could have used some of Rico's BBQ sauce for a sweet contrast instead of the semi-boring-more-like-brown-gravy cracked pepper demi. The meaty slabs were paired up with roasted garlic mashed potatoes that were well seasoned and comforting.   

Perfectly cooked and perfectly tender, the New York Strip Steak ($21) had a warm poblano and bacon relish that I could have eaten by the spoonful. The smoky sweet relish made the need for any sort of steak sauce not necessary. Along side was a heaping helping of green chile mac 'n' cheese, so creamy and so gone, delish. 

Apple Skillet For 2 ($7) takes apple slices simmered in a brown sugar and cinnamon, thanks to the wood-burning oven, then topped with cake crumbles and served with cinnamon vanilla gelato. If the skillet weren't so hot I would have licked it clean. 

While Rico's may not have yet achieved culinary greatness, what you do get is solid Southwestern influenced American grub.",neutral,en

My friend Lindsay knew I had been dying to go there (I love Postino--same owner and across the street--so I just knew Radio Milano was going to be amazing).

I've never met the man that owns these restaurants: La Grande Orange, Postino, Radio Milano etc (Lindsay apparently once did, lucky girl) but whoever he is, he is a business genius. 

The atmosphere of Radio Milano was sophisticated and classy without being uptight.  Everyone was extraordinarily nice and helpful.  True to form for this restaurateur's style, there is a large vase of (fresh every day) flowers that compliment the warm glow of the restaurant in general.

Our server welcomed us with what were presented as ""Italian Potato Chips"" and a delicious dipping sauce.

4,"I get a call on Thursday: ""Dude, I just got fired from UOP, we have to celebrate!"" If it was from anyone else but Ryan, I would have been shocked. However, he hated his job and we love Yard House, so I was definitely down to have some ""FU UOP"" drinks up at Desert Ridge.

Yard House has been one of our main spots for years. Right off the bat, the Happy Hour is fantastic; 100+ beers on tap, including some of AZ's finest and a couple amazing international brews. The servers usually do a great job of suggesting drinks as well. Traditionally I ""cleanse the palate"" with a Warsteiner Pilsner and roll from there. Friday night, I tipped back a few Kiltlifters as well, all brought in well frosted pint glasses.

The food has been pretty fantastic across the board. Personally, you can't go wrong with Firecracker Wings (sweet and very spicy wings) and the Spinach Dip. Their seared ahi appetizer and Caesar salad are both fantastic, with the ahi always perfectly cooked. The Southern Fried Chicken Breast is likely the best meal, though my pal is a huge fan of the Cuban Dip.

The one potential drawback is the service isn't always fast. Honestly, if you are going to relax and enjoy time with your friends, it's great. Beer glasses don't stay empty too long, waters get refilled (we only sit on the patio), and the food usually comes out before you get too hungry. Just understand that the joint gets busy for happy hour and you will enjoy the experience. Give me a call if you ever want to share some FU beers!",positive,en

1,"Until they get their quality under control, we won't eat here except for lunch. We ate here last weekend and both had the roasted chicken. The problem was it tasted like it was basted in cinnamon and the sauce for the risotto had at least 10 whole peppercorns on each of our plates. I actually bit into to one before I realized that the sauce was just crawling with them. They could've strained them out, processed them in, whatever, just don't serve me a plate with a bunch of whole peppercorns. This tasted NOTHING like the previous visit when I ordered the same exact dish. When we finally let the management know that our food was unacceptable, he said the best he could do was a 20% discount.

Came here for brunch on Sunday and was so impressed that I can say I will make it a point to come back! All the breads and desserts are made in house and I was told everything is made with fresh local ingredients when possible.

The atmosphere is great. We sat outside and it was nice with prompt service, casual vibe that reminded me of Seattle or Portland, and the FOOD.... Wowie.

There were three of us... all three did omelette's of different kinds. I recommend the Local Breeze, sans prosciutto. So good! You can get potatoes or spicy cottage cheese as a side - I went with the cottage cheese and it was delish. The bread is also amazing. Nice thick slices for the toast. Best whole wheat bread I've ever had in Phoenix.

Speaking of the bread - they have a killer menu of different french toast options. If I had not been on carb restriction, I would have had one for sure. NEXT TIME. The PB&J and the Nutella sound especially good. Our friend got a half order and it looked terrific. 

I cannot stress how good everything was. But I can only give them 4 stars and not 5 because the coffee was really bad. A good brunch should have good coffee to go with.

I was in the mood for booze, really when am I not in the mood for booze, and Francis, you saint you, you delivered this fantastic gin cooler. It was excellent and I made me think I should have a pool party and serve them to all my friends, or just sit at your bar and order another!

I'm sure the other non shredded meats are great on that bread, this might as well had just been the stuffing and cranberries on the bread.

5,"The Phoenix metro area is definitely not known for authentic Asian cuisine. China Magic Noodle House, however, is the real deal. This place reminds me of the Taiwanese delis that I used to go to in LA, as well as noodle houses that I've frequented in Taipei.

They have a great selection of cold noodle, hot noodle and soup noodle dishes. And, a variety of ways to have your noodles (I typically order the thick noodles or shaved noodles). There's always a veggie on the whiteboard to try and the fried tofu is very tender and tasty with the dipping sauce.

If you're looking for a reasonably priced, ethnically authentic meal in Phoenix (especially the East Valley), China Magic Noodle House should be near the top, if not first, on your list. the only negative that I would have about this place is that there isn't enough choices where chicken is the main protein.",positive,en
3,"I've been frequenting this Savers since the day it opened a few years back... 

They have a great one dollar tag sale on Mondays which is pure bliss I tell you!! Having a tough week, head over to Savers with a 20 dollar bill on Monday and you will come out a new woman with a new wardrobe!! 

My mother is the one who actually got me hooked on this deal lol.. The original frugality of the family lol. 

Overall, I cannot give this thrift store five stars just because I am a thrift store whore and have visited about every thrift store in and around the Phoenix area and have plenty of experience with many other thrift stores. 

This Savers requires a lot of digging, but some of my best finds have been a Dooney and Bourke gently used wallet for $16.00. Banana Republic black sling shoes for $5.99. Brand name NEW work out clothes and plenty of NEW with tags vintage dresses all under $9.99. 

This Savers is okay for just cheap everyday wear, other than that you won't find many unique and extravagant pieces here. Also, for some reason, everyone that shops here is really nice and friendly, no competiveness at all :)",neutral,en
4,"I went there on a Mon around 9:30 am. It was a ghost town and we got seated very quick.

I have to say they have the most comfortable seats!  I didnt sit in the chair but a like bench couch thing? Super soft.

The whole decor and music vibe was really cool, I really dugg it.

My girlfriend got  french toast (because she is a bitch and has to be super toned and fit with out working out or eating good)
which came with chicken apple sausage. Ok, heres the thing about that, I hate sausage(insert lesbian joke here) but it didnt have the typical sausagy flavors. It was really  really good. It was tangy salty and sweet. 
The french toast was extremely good. I think it may have been dipped in blueberry before cooked?

The waitress was super accomodating, and nice. 

Oh and they do have french press coffee which I was disappointed by , but after I had it.. holly crap best coffee ever!!!! it was smooth had good flavors, no bitterness at all. 

The only use butter and vegetable oil which is soo nice to see they dont load you up with horrible for you margerine. 

My only complaint is, I ordered a sandwich and got a totally different one. When I told them she went to the cooks and found out they didnt have that bread and randomly added egg? 

She took it back and it was no big deal but she informed me it was only a month old and were still learning the menu.

We shared some cheese and bacon fries. I ordered chicken pesto pasta and she ordered a club sandwich.

5,"The Farm at South Mountain is a splendid little slice of the country- right here in the middle of the desert!

The plentiful green grass spotted with picnic tables makes me want to plan a family reunion. There are gardens and walkways to explore. From first glance, The Farm is a quaint, family-run farmhouse.

Visit Morning Glory Cafe for breakfast and you won't be disappointed. I've personally enjoyed the Morning Glory Benedict on several occasions, while my brother is a big fan of the Farm Monte Cristo. Both dishes are made with as many local ingredients as possible... mmm... local-icious. 

The Farm Monte Cristo is about as close as any breakfast food gets to ""groin-grabbingly delicious."" (a la Homer Simpson) It's slow baked ham, over easy eggs, and melted cheese between two generous pieces of French Toast. Served with warm maple syrup, this is it, folks. The grand-daddy of breakfast foods. 

The service here is generally solid. Our servers tend to be interesting, friendly, and adorable- all good qualities to have when you're serving breakfast to someone who isn't happy about being up early.

I'll return... and return... and return. I'm hooked.

The whole process is pretty painless and I think their drugs are priced reasonably.  They will also hand deliver the medication the same day if you ask nicely.

Pro Tip:  When you call, don't hang up right away when you get the recorded message.  When you stay on the line it will begin to ring again and someone may answer.  I thought the recorded message was an answering machine and hung up prematurely a few times.  Also, sometimes the line just rings and rings and rings.

4,"I love Los Favoritos!  Mi favorito is the chorizo breakfast burrito (most popular item there?).  Interestingly enough, I think it's bigger if you order it for dinner than for breakfast, but for either it's plenty big!  Muy rico with salsa verde.  I'm embarrassed to say that I've only had a few of other things on the menu (quesadilla and other burritos), but they've all been delish!  For some reason, though, I just get my mouth set on chorizo burrito.  It's seductive.
The folks there are very nice and sincere, and they know English well enough, although I think some are working on it.  
Tip:  You can order ahead!  Especially helpful if you're going during the lunch rush, when it seems like every kid from Seton H.S. is there.  it's pretty nice to breeze in and pay and grab your stuff when there's a gaggle of folks still waiting for their order to be called.    
Tip 2:  If you don't order ahead, you can place your order there and then go across the courtyard to Starbucks to grab a coffee (that probably costs more than what you got at Los Fav's) while you wait for your food, if you're so inclined.  This is a bad habit you might not want to get into.  Believe me!",positive,en

Misses:

- Waitress was never able to bring the ""last call"" round of HH she offered.  No explanation or apology.  

- Asked if I ""minded"" anchovies on my salad.  I said ""no,"" but didn't realize there would be an upcharge until the final bill came.

Well, it is cute. The lighting and furniture and concept are happy, kind and appealing in an innocent way. The patio is cute, too.

4,"The Paseo Trail travels through Chandler along the Consolidated Canal.  It runs mostly N-S, connecting to other trails along the canal in Mesa and Gilbert, totaling around 18 miles.

The trail is mostly paved on the east side of the canal and pea gravel hard pack on the west side.  It runs along subdivisions, golf courses and even a couple farms.  The grade is very gentle throughout.  I would consider the trail primarily for use by joggers, bicyclists and equestrians.

There is parking at the address listed for the trail and nearby parking at Tumbleweed Recreation Center at McQueen and Germann.  There is also easy to find street parking near many of the junctions with major streets.  A good southern starting point is off of Riggs Rd. between Arizona and McQueen.  There is plenty of street parking.  From here the ride north is mostly a slight uphill ride, making the return trip a nice relaxing roll.

One issue with the trail is crossings with major streets.  Most are not marked for motorists as trail crossings and there is no crosswalk so you may be faced with a relatively long wait to get a break in traffic or forcing the issue and forging ahead with care.",positive,en
3,"3.5 stars for me.  My first thought upon walking in was ""wow, it's small.""  Not a bad thing necessarily.  Could be a good thing in fact.

I ordered a ""Blushing Lady"" cocktail (gin, Citronage, lemon juice, simple syrup, and a splash of sloe gin).  I'm pretty sure it was served in a dribble glass because I seemed to have difficulty actually consuming it.  But what I did have was perfect for me, and I would like another.

I also opted for the special that evening which was a tenderloin sandwich with poblano, swiss, watercress, and charred onion.  While the poblano and onion sold me on it, I didn't quite get the swiss and watercress.  It was good, but could have been better with another cheese IMHO.  Also tried the herbed fries (delicious) and the mac 'n cheese (not as delicious).  The mac 'n cheese was good, but lacked the gooey cheesiness I crave.  We finished with warm doughnuts and salted butterscotch.  Doughnuts were fantastic, and it's hard not to like the butterscotch, but the ""salted"" part was missing.  A touch more please.

I had kinda forgotten about The Grind, but now that I'm reminded of it, it's worth a second visit.",neutral,en

A couple of summer rolls filled with shrimp, pork and vermicelli, dipped in the sweet peanutty sauce, a dash of their house hot sauce(a tad more fire than the ""cock"" sauce) and we were off to  a fine start. I was feeling better already.

The Pho arrived, and the aromas were simply intoxicating. After a short interlude of vaporized euphoria, we dug in, adding the usual lime, cilantro, basil, sprouts and aforementioned hot sauce. Commence slurping.

The broth was simple yet complex in layered flavors. Noodles were perfect in abundance and texture. My companion chose beef and shrimp and declared they were cooked perfectly. I selected the special beef which included shank, brisket, tendon, tripe and meatball. Outstanding.

Service was with a smile, prompt and attentive. I honestly felt like I was sitting in someone's home enjoying what they might eat on a daily basis. I do not think that Cyclo can compare, while good, this just seemed more authentic.",positive,en
1,"I just finished my G & S meal that I ordered to-go; actually, I just finished throwing it out. It was HORRIBLE. And by horrible, I mean shamefully bad. And by shamefully bad, I mean, heinous! I had a very disappointing experience here about a year ago but I thought I would give it another try. I should have proceeded with caution when I asked the long-term employees at the neighboring Blockbuster what was good and to the person, they all stammered and failed to reply. Seriously, zero out of four could give me one ""great"" dish! I've lived in both Mpls & Chicago and my Ex used to travel the Orient and we were always surprised at how POOR the quality of Asian food was in this area and WHY the people here, seemed to like it!? It's absolutely baffling!
I had the Orange Beef & Spring Rolls. The Orange Beef looked scarey right in the container. But when i ate it - UGH! The texture was all off and the sauce..... it had these big, clear, GELATINOUS, ..... ugh ugh ugh! I can't even talk about it. Like biting into a ball of corn-starchy orange extract! I'm still sick from those few bites! [Truly.] And while I ordered vegetable spring rolls, I got what tasted like low-quality hamburger meat! In fact I finally identified the flavor and texture as: SAUSAGE! It was like an Asian Spring Roll with chunks of Italian Sausage inside!! How's that for a combo? Ugh...... [stomach turning]
I'm sorry, I'm a Single Parent and I'm usually grateful to have someone cook for me. Grateful even when i am paying. But during ""tough times"" when i actually ""treat"" myself and then plunk down $20(!!) for unedible... yuck - it's totally, TOTALLY unacceptable!

3,"Went here on Wednesday to take advantage of the $30 certificate. It was quite busy, which probably shouldn't of been a shock, location and all, so had to wait awhile but that is the risk of not getting reservations right? =P. 

Anyways, spent time in the bar which was nice, the bartenders were willing to answer questions, though not always the most chatty, but I think that was due more to how busy it was then not being friendly. The happy hour prices looked pretty good, $2 hot sake, $3 beer, $4-5 cocktails. Sushi was also on the cheap, Nigiri was from about 1.25-2 dollars I believe, and the other rolls ran from 3-5 dollars at the worst. They also have some non-sushi appetizers on there. 

Once we got a table, we were paired with another group, which was actually a nice experience as I do like the communal type seating stuff. Granted if you have a small group and not a fan of eating with strangers, might not like it much. 

Since it is a place I always consider more about a show then the food, going to start with that first. The show was eh, they do some of the knife play stuff, and a few things here and there, but honestly it wasn't all that exciting compared to the other place I've been (Sakura). The chef was friendly though, and the server was personable so that is a plus. Otherwise was a bit disappointed with the show portion of the meal. 

As for the food, I had the Filet Mignon and lobster tail. The filet was supposed to be medium, but came out more medium well in my opinion. It was lightly seasoned, leaving mostly a beef flavor then anything else. Now it had a good beef flavor, so by no means complaining just like a bit more seasoning personally. The lobster tail was good, buttery from the butter, but more importantly nice and sweet. How it is to other lobster tails? can't really tell you as I don't eat it that much (college students don't exactly have that sort of cash you know? =P). But again thought it was good, wasn't fishy and nice and sweet. 

At the end it came with a choice of ice cream, I tried the green tea ice cream which about the same as any other green tea ice cream I've had. Basically its sweet, with a hint of green tea taste, and that is about it. 

They have to sing to you of course, and they take a picture which they give you with a code you can access for up to 60 days (I believe) to download it, which is a nice touch. 

For the money, I really wouldn't go unless I had the certificate, however I would go back for the happy hour, probably my favorite thing of the whole night.",neutral,en

1,"ZERO stars!
I traveled from STL to SFO a few weeks ago (with a layover in PHX). I have a couple complaints;
One, I was checking 2 pieces of luggage in STL. One ended up being 14lbs. over weight (it was a cooler with food I bring home each year from my dad). I was charged an additional $90 on top of the $35 initially for the cooler to ship (including the $25 for my first bag- so $150 total)! This is an OUTRAGEOUS additional charge! I thought overweight bags were charged an additional $25 like other airlines I've had to pay at but $120 to ship one bag is just insane (and a set price for overweight bags is NOT listed on your website)! On top of that I paid $250 for a pet ticket so my baggage fees were $400 total... $100 more than my round trip ticket to fly. I couldn't believe that!
On another note, the woman agent helping me at STL was the most rude customer service agent I've ever dealt with anywhere! She was rude to me about the overweight baggage and then claimed my dog was too tall to fit in her carrier so she claimed she wouldn't allow her to fly. She raised he voice at me and called me ""a very inhumane person"" for making a dog ride like that for a whole flight; seriously making me cry. I fly all over the country to do shows with my dog and this has never been a problem, including on the first leg of my trip when I bought the round trip dog ticket in SFO. This woman name-calling was totally inappropriate... people in line beside me were astonished. Since I had my round trip dog ticket purchased already, and she was sick of fighting with me over it, she let me go but told me the gate person probably wouldn't let me on the flight (and of course the gate person did).
Between the dog crate episode and the bags, I have never been treated so poorly and charged with such ridiculously high adage fees. I'm very disappointed to not be able to fly US Air anymore since I never had problems with them in the past. It was a horrible way to end a very nice holiday vacation.

3,"First I will admit to not being a very impartial critic here-I absolutely adore a good bowl of ramen.  Although I've not been to Japan I've been fortunate enough to visit some outstanding ramen houses in Seattle, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Jose.
While I think this is probably some of the better ramen I've had in Arizona, unfortunately that's not really saying much.  It was okay, not great.
I ordered the miso ramen with chashu hoping against hope that I'd have a reasonable facsimilie to Santouka's spicy miso available in the Mitsuwa stores around the country-drool.....  The noodles were decent, though I wish there was more of them.  The broth was not very miso-y and lacked the depth that really makes the ramen bowl.  The chashu was really the weak point, sliced thin pork with no real discernable chashu quality.  The accompanying vegetables were fine although I wouldn't say it's what I'm used to/looking for.
In short I'd say this is Americanized ramen-and no, not the cheap junk from the package but suited more for an American palate instead of leaning toward authenticity.  No fish cake or bamboo shoots, none of the cloudy unctuous broth, no pork belly chashu.
The place looks great and the staff is great, I wouldn't dismiss it but Republic doesn't get a fervent recommendation either.",neutral,en

5,"Even for meat eaters, Green has a lot to love. A lot more than just tofu! I go here at least a couple times a month for lunch and it's spectacular 95% of the time. A few of our favorite items are the BBQ ""Chicken"" sandwich, Thee Argentine sandwich, the crab puffs and of course, the Tsoynamis. Everything is fairly priced ($8 for a sandwich, $7.50 for a bowl w/ your choice or rice or noodles). The only thing I don't particularly care for is the buffalo wings as I think they are far too salty. The ranch that it comes with is fantastic, though. Also, if you get something with cheese make sure to use Daiya instead of Teese. Daiya tastes much better, in my opinion.

The atmosphere is very artsy. There are always paintings for sale and there are a bunch of old car doors and hub caps over to one side. They just got a few booths which is fantastic if you want a little privacy. There is free wifi, a booshelf will all sorts of great reading, and the staff is always super friendly.

Another great thing about Green is the vegan market. They have all sorts of great vegan foods and books for you to spoil yourself with. It's the only place I know of where you can find Teese, Food for Lovers Queso and Soy Curls. As an aside, I highly recommend Soy Curls as a healthy replacement to the meat in your fajitas or cheesesteaks.

Another thing you absolutely must check out is their annual ThanksLIVING festival on Thanksgiving. They will load you up will all sorts of delicious and traditional Thankgsiving day food, veganized. ""Turkey"", stuffing, biscuits, brussels sprouts, asparagus, cranberry sauce, gravy, corn, pie and a drink. You'll get guest speakers, live music and local arts and crafts. Highly recommend.",positive,en
5,"Really?  Because it doesn't get any better than this.  For what it is and for what it's worth this place is truly unique.  A slight step up from a hole in the wall type of place, this quaint spot serves up good, tasty, and satisfying food hot from the kitchen.

What is a pasty?

A pasty's history can be associated with the tin miners in England.  The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface.  Supposedly, the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the ""handles"" and when done, discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines.

At the Cornish Pasty Co. I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto.  Very good flavoring and filling.  Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef, potatoes, and swede.  The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well.

Pros
* Good food
* Originality
* Portions
* Customer service
* Coat hooks at the bar

Cons
* Small interior",positive,en

I did not like the fact that the hostess attempted to seat my companion and I all the way in the back of the restaurant, passing up several unserved tables. Nope, not on my watch. We split the fish sandwich and a chicken sandwich. I really really liked the fish sandwich. The flavors were layered and intense. The chopped kale salad was a nice alternative to a traditional garden salad. The chicken sandwich was a little bland. Our waitress was on top of it, I think her name was Lisa.

Mulligans is that bar where you can go and kick it with your friends. You never know what kind of people you are going to run into. Co-workers, drunkards, bottle rats who got kicked out from other places.

Comes with the traditional crust, which was really enjoyable, but also available w/thin crust or wheat crust ($2 extra for wheat).
Server (Zach) was nice, offered suggestions, and was on top of things. Kind of soft spoken, given the tv's and other restaurant noise. Hostess seemed like she was pretty excited to be there and everyone was polite.
Prices weren't too bad--$18 for a large pizza, $8 for an individual. Variety of toppings, salads, appetizers, calzones, and drinks. Beers ranged from $3.75-$5 for the 16 oz.

2,"Ok so I get the peanut thing, wood accented atmosphere, good service (although rather ""in your face"" at times) and the packed dining room / bar even on a Thursday night. 

What I don't get is the awful food. This was my FIRST (and last) visit into this franchise restaurant. How they convinced franchisees and the general public to invest and vote with hard earned dollars is beyond me.

I took my friends 11 year old there after he played in a b'ball game and after looking at the menu and pricing decided to split the rib eye special $19.99. 

I got the fried pickle appetizer as well and was sorely disappointed in the batter and both of the ""dipping sauces"" (watery ranch and thousand island? I really couldn't tell).  Even a franchise like H***ers makes them WAY better......wow.

On to the main course. The baked potato with butter and cream cheese was overcooked or something? I have never had a potato that seemed to have been soaked in some type of brine and then baked? Kind of par boiled or something. Anyway the color was greyish and the taste like that of a fishy sea salt.

Moving to the broccoli i was greeted by a palor yellow looking presentation. I couldn't tell if it was cheesy cauliflower or ? Wow the taste was again that of something really overcooked or under matured...YICK

The last chance at redemption came with the medium well rib eye. Good sized portion and easily split between the two of us 20oz. Good wholesome beefy taste and great texture only to be squallored  by a heavy Saltiness....not sure where this was picked up from but maybe by hanging out too close to the potato? 

I really am normally an amicable restaurant patron but after forking over $46 including tip for two to split some food and getting served what we did ...well you get my drift.

The indoor track is free to walk and is air conditioned - bonus for those walkers who dread the summer heat.  Use of the gym is at a cost - I think around $60 for the year, so it's pretty inexpensive but the gym is pretty small.  

They offer a variety of fitness/dance classes, at a cost, including: aerobics, ballet, belly dance, kickboxing, pilates and yoga + many more.  They also offer specialty education classes including: oil painting, computers and spanish.  I have taken a few of the classes and they are pretty inexpensive and last for a few months at a time - either once or twice weekly. It seems that they offer a lot of classes and activities for kids and seniors as well.

4,"Oooh!  A shiny new pizza spot!  I have been told time and time again to try Barro's, so the opening of this location was the perfect opportunity to put it to my pepperoni and mushroom test.  All I can say is What Took Me So Long!?  This pizza is GOOD!  Zesty sauce, ample topping coverage and a puffy pillow-like outer crust.  It looks like it would be chewy, but it is not.  How do they do that?  Some sort of pizza alchemy, I am sure.

This location is brand new.  The dark wood floors and high-backed booths (that don't yet have butt-indentations from previous guests) are not the typical plastic red/green/white decor what you would expect from a casual pizza restaurant.  The staff is friendly, both on the phone and in person, which is nice.  

In addition to fantastic whole pies, they also have inexpensive lunch specials (2 slices and a soda for $4 is my favorite!) until 4pm every day.

My only small sadness is that this location does not deliver to my house (even though it is closer than the Barro's that does cover my delivery area).  Oh well, I like this one and will probably visit more than is good for me!",positive,en

4,"It had been a few years since I last gave this place a try. It hadn't blown me away as I had remembered, but I was still up to giving it another shot.  I must say that this place is much better than I had remembered. I stopped in for lunch and there were several people eating in there at the time. I ordered the Luncheon Special #3 (Cashew Chicken served with an egg roll, fried wonton, fried rice, and a fortune cookie) for myself and a #1 special (Qwik special chicken which also came with all the additional stuff mentioned above) for a friend to go.  Each dish was only $6.25 a piece and were both ready in about 7 minutes. I guess the Qwik part wasn't just a clever name, they actually do cook stuff up pretty fast there.  I brought the food back to the office and tried my lunch. Yes, I also made sure to give my friend his lunch as well.  It was a dark meat chicken, white meat can be substituted, in your typical brown sauce with veggies and cashews. However it was done well. No one ingredient dominated the dish and there wasn't a ton of sauce. The egg roll was crispy and flaky and filled with veggie goodness as well. I like the fact that they will deliver as far south as Camelback, north to Cactus, east to 60th street, and west to 96th. They are open until 9:30 pm seven days a week which is nice as well. I went back to try some of the soups and the dumplings and I have to say that while the soup was good, the dumplings may just be in the top 3 that I have had in Arizona. They don't have that ""just unfrozen"" taste that many restaurants have. I think I would have given them that fifth star had they had both scallion pancakes and noodles w/ sesame sauce on their menu, but alas they do not.

Don't get me wrong: it is completely, totally, and utterly delicious. Their fries were far superior to many traditional burger joints'. But... they're still FRENCH FRIES, people. The jerk tofu salad was impressively spicy, but laden in too-many FRIED won ton strips and chunks of FRIED tofu. Do you see the theme? No wonder my SO nodded enthusiastically throughout the whole meal and offered to come back any time. 

I had the G po-boy, buffalo ""chicken"" on a big spongy roll, dripping and oozing in spicy sauce and vegan mayo. The fake meat they use is really, really, really authentic. Like, so authentic, I'm not going to get it next time because I really don't like meat in the first place, hence my vegetarianism. Stringy fibers in my fake chicken grosses me out as much as the stringy fibers in real chicken. The sandwich was tasty -- the bread surprisingly excellent -- but greasy.

1,"Don't know where I should start. Grand opening was on September 17th, 2010. We went to try this new Dim Sum place at the Mekong Plaza as they heavily advertised in the chinese newspapers and were advertising 30% off.

When I got there, the biggest eyesore is that they tried to make their portion of the Food Court as a regular ""Chinese"" restaurant. So imagine the picture of chandeliers hanging in the middle of a food court in the mall. It just looks too tacky, I thought they should've went with a more fast food type Dim sum like they have in San Gabriel, California.

Upon checking in with the hostess, they don't even issue numbers, they only call you by name. So that was already pretty different from how usual chinese restaurant run things. Totally not efficient at all.

Once we finally got a seat, things got worse.

Our ""Har Gow""/Shrimp dumpling was raw! The skin was thick and clumpy, the shrimp was severely undercooked. We asked them to exchange for another one, and it was still raw. We also had to exchange the shrimp egg roll as it was also raw. Their excuse was that they were too busy and did not have time to fully cook the food. Ok.....so how are the other 100s of asian restaurants able to serve dim sum at a fast pace with fully cooked food? That was probably the lamest excuse.

The trademark ""beef internal organs"" that I always love to order was pathetic. They charged the large price for a tiny little bowl, there were only a few tendons and mostly filled with Daikon. 

The BBQ Pork bun, another staple of Dim sum, was not that great either. There was barely any char siu in the bun, and the exterior of the bun was not fully cooked.

I understand that it is their first operating weekend, but the idea of a nice chinese dimsum place at a food court just doesn't fly in my opinion. They even offer wedding banquets here too. 

I don't think I'll be returning here unless they really upgrade the quality of the food. The idea is definitely novel, but will be a hard sell.",negative,en

5,"With a few hours past and a few tasks accomplished the next stop of my day would be at Pane Bianco - the sandwich shop from the Valley's most celebrated Chef, Chris Bianco.  Having made my pilgrimage to the eponymous pizzeria during my first trip to Phoenix, Pane had been on my radar since the day I moved to town but given the lunch-only hours and my office location in North Scottsdale I knew a weekend would be best and as luck would have it a new website (http://www.pizzeriabianco.com/) and seven day 11a-3p schedule had been rolled out just the week prior.

Arriving at the surprisingly large space (especially when compared to Matt's and JoBot from earlier that day - and compared to Pizzeria Bianco as well) shortly after 11:30 and allocating parking in the free lot juxtaposing the Light Rail I debated for a moment whether dine-in or to-go was best and opting for the former made my way into the restaurant where two couples already sat.  Greeted by one of two servers it was suggested I could take ""any seat I wanted"" and opting for a bench in the center of the room where a menu awaited I sat down to browse the menu as well as the daily specials listed on the chalkboard - almost all sounding appealing, but a bit different than the Saturday special listed on the website.  With a small list of beverages available I was asked soon if I was ready to order or if I needed a few minutes I deferred and requested a glass of water that would never reach even half-empty despite me drinking from it consistently and the restaurant soon filling to capacity.

Having debated the specials but eventually undeterred from the reason I'd come in the first place I soon placed my order for a sandwich and an 'appetizer' which I was told would be 'just a few minutes' and as while I waited I checked out the small market at the Take Away section featuring the famous focaccia, cans of tomatoes, dried pasta, and apparel before returning to my seat where my items would arrive shortly - the first a Manchego and Tomato Sauce Focaccia del Giorno featuring Bianco's delectable wood fired focaccia in all of its spongy glory topped with sweet, ripe tomatoes and an ample layer of briny Manchego; at $4.50 probably the most expensive ""Grandma Slice"" I've ever had yet at the same time also probably the best...or at least on par with that at DiFara in Brooklyn for best of its genre.

Moving next to the original target of my desire, a sandwich of Bianco's House Made Mozzarella, Tomatoes, and Basil on Wood Fired Focaccia my first thought was ""wow - that is a lot of cheese"" while my second, after a bite, was ""wow - that is a lot of flavor.""  Perhaps as pure of a sandwich as you can find and the result of exquisite ingredients on top quality bread there is really nothing 'special' about the composition of this sandwich aside from the fact that it simply works - a largely unmanipulated masterpiece only improved by a touch of sea salt and cracked black pepper.

Largely unaware on entering that Pane serves dessert it was with much delight that I realized soon after sitting down that three options were available that day and while the flourless chocolate cake I saw emerge from the kitchen to the table next to me looked quite nice there was simply no way I was passing up the Organic Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding with Candied Pecans - another simplistic stunner with creamy Arborio rice imbued with a rich vanilla custard flicked with whole vanilla beans and a few pecans for crunch.  Delicate and smooth, flavorful without being overly sweet, and *almost* thick enough to stand a spoon up straight it was not quite the best rice pudding I've ever had - but a top five contender without a shadow of a doubt - a reason in and of itself to return to Pane Bianco...though to be fair, if I returned it would take pretty spectacular daily specials to prevent me from ordering the exact same trio of items once again.  With Chris and his team now two for two it is only a matter of time before I make my way to Italian Restaurant... and honestly, that time is likely measured in hours and days as opposed to weeks and months.",positive,en

I wanted to book a diner for my wife and I ( our anniversary.
. The website i was on did not post the times of operation.  I left a message and today got a call back from a RUDE Owner.  He argues it is right there. He did not ask anything about where i was o tried to help . He called to argue  with me. 
 I can not believe i get a call at work and then when i tell the reason of the issue he argues with me and hangs up... childish behavior . I read the reviews on DEX and other sites and found that this is true across the board. Poor food prep and pretentious environment and owners... good bye Lon's  chief - ill never go to your location now.  And my 12,000 Sedona list will  be aware of your bad manners.  I am a native to Scottsdale and Lon's was a place that we went to almost 6 times a year. It was my mother's favorite place to eat. - until the food started going down hill.

3,"I've only ever been here for Transylvania which is their Friday night Gothic Industrial night.  It's acceptable.  I have high standards.  Sometimes the music is really good.  Sometimes it sucks.  They have 2 DJs and I can always tell when the switch from the one whose tastes I enjoy to the one whose tastes I don't.  If you're looking for Death Bunnis, Razor Grrls, Baby Bats or *sigh* Suicide Girls, you'll find a few of them here.  There are a lot of regulars and I usually have a good time, unless of course I don't.  The people there have all been fairly nice.

The drinks are nothing special.  They aren't terrible, they just aren't terribly consistent.  If you need to get wasted, get some shots poured. At least that way you know what you're getting.

So when you need to strap on your boots, wear your eyeliner, and shake your ass, give it a shot.",neutral,en
1,"If you like sushi, go somewhere else. I was extremely disappointed in the quality of both the service and the food. 

I decided to take my family here because the other reviews seemed good; however, either my experience was an anomaly or the other Phoenix yelpers and I have stark differences in taste.

The staff had great smiles, yet lacked follow through. We had to ask for water and extra ginger twice. The sushi rolls were the flimsiest I have ever seen! Although poor in quality, they were high in price for what they serve. I'm not sure about the names of some of their rolls...one was named ""Climax."" Gross and just distasteful.  

The decor and ambiance leave you wanting. They have three different wallpapers hanging and the music is overwhelming. 

Even though this is the only sushi bar in Surprise, I will gladly drive to Peoria or Scottsdale the next time I have a craving for sushi.",negative,en

3,"Breadfruit is a cool spot. The interior of the place is well decorated and they can only seat about 15-20 people, making a nice, intimate ambiance. I really appreciate that they serve locally grown organic produce and that their chicken is all natural and raised cage free. Any addition of a Jamaican restaurant down town earns at least three stars in my book. We arrived at 7:30pm and were the only people there throughout almost the entire meal..

We brought our own bottle of wine and there was only a $5 corking fee, not to shabby.

We started with the plantain and avacado spring rolls, I really liked that wonton was baked and not deep fried, the presentation was nice, the mango chutney was fresh but the rolls themselves lacked flavor. I really wished they would have paired some other fruit or spice to add more contrast to the dish. 

For my main I got the jerk chicken and I was a little disappointed. Again they did an excellent job with the presentation, but the corn was mushy and what the jerk rub lacked in flavor they tried to make up for in spice.  I like spicy, and can handle a lot of heat, but heat shouldn't overpower flavor...

The chef/owner came out and asked us how we enjoyed our meal, and explained his philosophy behind the food. The service was excellent, but in comparison to some other Jamaican places I've been, it really only warrants 3 stars (sorry)!",neutral,en

Once we found it and stepped inside, we were definitely wow'd! The waiter answered our questions about the food, and suggested that if we really want the Ethiopian experience, to try out the Strictly Vegan combo. We ordered Tikil Gomen, Misir Watt, Kik Misir Watt, Gomen Watt, Shuro Watt, and the Dubba. We fell in love with the Shuro and the Misir Watt. The Shuro is chickpeas in a cinnamon/spicy sauce, and the Misir is spiced lentils. Soooo tasty! Even non-vegetarians will enjoy this place, and they do have meat dishes.",positive,en
1,"The bill was 150.00 and that was after a free appetizer coupon they sent me via email.  The food was no where near worth the HIGH price!  The service was not up to par either.  I really can't believe people pay such high prices for food that come with NO sides, etc.  I got iced tea to drink and it cost a whopping $6.00.  That's right folks....6.00 for a glass of tea.  What is that 100% profit/mark up?  I paid 12.00 for a soup sampler.  Each of the three soups were in a tiny espresso cup.  My salmon was no better than what I get at Texas roadhouse but it was three times the price.  I would definitely not recommended this place.  If you want a fancy, awesome meal go to Houston's!  The one thing that was great were the rolls (they were free too)!  Don't get me wrong the food is good but not worth the price tag!

5,"Stinkweeds shaped my formative years.  Really.

I started shopping at the (now gone) Tempe location when I was 15.  I had a few older friends into independent music who introduced me to this record store.  I begged my parents for rides and, when that wasn't happening, hopped on the bus for the hour-long trek.  Totally worth it.  100%.  I can't tell you how many awesome bands I began listening to just because I would browse the selection endlessly for something that looked interesting.  If I needed something specifically, Stinkweeds would order it for me if they didn't already have it in stock.  The staff was always welcoming and helpful, sometimes offering their own suggestions.

But it's just a record store, right?  Wrong.  Stinkweeds is the jewel of Phoenix, as far as I am concerned.  Now that it's out in central Phoenix, I make it in far less.  Total bummer!",positive,en
5,"These are simply the BEST sandwiches and salads. If you like your food (a) locally grown; (b) freshly made; (c) organic/all natural; and (d) yummy - and who doesn't? - this is the place for you.

Now, admittedly they have something of a soup-nazi routine set up and if you walk in and don't know the drill, it can be confusing.  So pay attention:   
1.  Look at menu.
2.  Decide what you want.
3.  Wait your turn to order.
4.  Order (give your name).
5.  Wait your turn to be called to pay the other girl for the order you placed.
6.  Pay her.
7.  Wait until your food is ready.
8.  Leave with your food.

Note that there is no place to sit inside - so you can either sit outside, or, (if it is 157 degrees out that day), see if you can find a place to sit over at LUX, they are very welcoming of Pane Bianco diners.

4,"Someone asked the question in the Yelp talk threads where the best place was for fried things, like french fries and onion rings.  Several people said Ted's had great onion rings......so off I went!  

I expected a smaller place but I was pleasantly suprised when I pulled up to a medium sized store.  I was greated with a smile and asked what I would like.  It was a Sunday afternoon so they were not very busy.  I liked the fact that you tell them what you want and they toss it on the grill right in front of you.  Everything is freshly cooked.  They did the same with the onion rings and french fries too.  Everything was fresh and hot.  My daughter had her favorite....a hot dog, which she loved, and fries which were fresh and crisp.  I had a burger and onion rings.  Yes, the onion rings were delicious!  The batter was great and the onions were a little on the sweet side.  My burger was cooked to perfection.  

This is another great little place we will go back to.  It's also sort of near my work so maybe I'll get out one day and go here for lunch.  Thanks Ted's and Yelpers!",positive,en
2,"If you're into smoke that reeks all over...this is the casino for you.  It sure ain't Vegas where you don't smell any smoke.  Peeee---uuuuu!  Stinky.
And if that wasn't bad enough:  I went with a group of friends and we all ate at the buffet.  Now, in all honesty, some of the food there was pretty good:  the shrimp, the prime rib beef, the stuffed cheese lasagna, etc.
Some was pretty bad like the ceviche  and the desserts--OMG--how bad they are.  
My cheesecake was, obviously, a day or two old and had that refrigerator slightly hard crusting over it--plus, ever so slight smell from the fridge.
Not yummy.  The pies were alot of filling and few pieces of fruit.  Just cheap desserts, so stick with the meat and fish.
Here is the coup de gras, tho.  I was given a $4 comp on my player's card.  I went to 3 different machines and they were all BROKEN!  
Finally I find one that lit up green so I knew the players card was working.
And guess what?  The $4 comp money never showed up on the card.
If this Casino thinks I would actually spend money to sit in their stinking cigarette smoke loaded casino, they have another think coming.  Hell no!
I also had a ticket to see their Showstoppers ""show"" which, if it sucked as much as their slots and crappy old desserts, I figured it wasn't worth it.
On my way out to go home, I pitched both their non-working player's card and their ticket to the ""show.""  I knew I would have more fun watching reruns of Sex and the City at home than boring myself even more.
Goodbye, Casino Arizona.  You have alot of people in that casino so you're making money off some sucker...just not this sucker.

This cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if I hadn't been driving down Palm Rd to avoid construction.  While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the ""Grand Opening"" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!  A new place to try!

It looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside.  I ordered dinner for two, to go.  The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!

As if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!  I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah.  There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar, it's amazing.  All the paintings are great, love the artist.",positive,en

The wine recommended was their chianti which tasted pretty bad, they have a weird assortment of imported beers, and like a couple other reviews the pizza had little flavor.  We order a PESTO chicken pizza and we had to bite around on each piece to find the pesto, no flavor, a bit dry and the pizza was really late and warm - late and warm which means =  sat there for a while.  Our waitress was nice, cute, fun but hey that only gets you 2 stars.   The salad was better than the pizza and the wings were pretty good. - Thats all folks.!!",negative,en
4,"Couple things.  First, I am reviewing a Delivery order that I placed.  (If you didn't know that they delivered... Now you do!)

You start by looking at their website, which is modest.  It's a black background with White text.  Pretty much all of their food is available for take-out, except for the alcohol.

*TIP* Make sure to look at their PDF Menu.  It has TONS of more choices than what is listed on their Website.  I wasn't even aware of this fact until I had ordered my food.

At this point, they do not have online ordering set up, so you call and place your order that way.

Cornish Pasty's (pronounced Pastie, not Pastey) are amazingly delicious.  They take whatever filling you choose (from the Chicken Alfredo to the Bangers and Mash), and they place it in a thin, crisp dough that surrounds it.  Think of a Calzone, except the Irish version.

Now, these are very, very filling.  They are modestly priced (all of them are less than $10), and they are EXTREMELY DELICIOUS.

Make sure you give them a try.  I will sure be eating here again!",positive,en

I won't go into the local ingredients, Agritopia, etc since others already have but it is a wonderful thing. More below.

The food was awesome. Very fresh, delicious and wholesome - you actually felt like you were eating food that was also good for you. Granted we just had the burgers and ice cream but there's a whole menu there to explore on future visits. I loved the signature burger with pesto & fontina, neither of which I had ever thought of but worked very well. The onion rings were good, as were the milkshakes and sundae. It really fills you up fast though, so try to pace yourself!

I was equally enchanted with the setting. Beautiful place. Just like a farm oasis in the midst of suburbia - I hope it doesn't vanish in the midst of the houses all around it. Even the bathroom was noteworthy - clean, black and white with dolls and a closed circuit tv. It reminded me of the Jetsons - you know, the 60s idea of space age. 

Sitting outside wasn't too hot, as it's the one place I've seen so far where the misters really work and don't just spray you and puddle down.  The only down side was when I asked where the farm stand was and the cashier pointed it out, but without mentioning it was closed. Nor was there a sign at the actual location indicating when it would be open in the fall.

Oh, and what was really nice was the sense of everyone relaxing - just kicking back and having a good time. definitely worth going to again, and again ...",positive,en
4,"Just down Scottsdale Rd from the plastic, the cougars, the roid rage, and the Delta Bravos is a little place that doesn't give a shit, in the best possible way. 

In many ways, this is the dive bar Scottsdale doesn't deserve but needs oh so badly (and let's face it, being south of McDowell probably means you are not in Scottsdale by many people's account, which is just fine). 

To be clear, let's discuss some things a dive bar is...First, they serve drinks and beer. No basil martinis, No Sonoma pinot noir, and No craft double IPAs. Second, you do not come here to be seen or for a scene...see the first point for what you come here for. Third, the motif...none...unless you count a few characters at the bar. 

Now those are the basics, but Rogue Bar adds in great local and national acts, a diverse, non-Old Town crowd, and a friendly staff. 

For instance, I recently saw The Mulhollands, from LA, and I assure you, this band will soon be playing venues where you won't be getting up on stage with the band...not that anyone I know did such things. 

That is a great thing about RB, the lack of pretense carries throughout all aspects...even the DJ let me play with his DJ toys. 

Yes, yes, you don't want to model your toilet after theirs, the pool table is old, and you may see a fight. But, these are added flavor for a true dive bar. 

At the end of night you can say you had the chance to -- crash in some comfy booths, play some pool, order pizza for the bar, meet some real people, have a cheap drink, and if you are lucky, hang out with the band at an after party. 

If you like a dive bar, go. If you don't, stay up the road, nobody will miss you at Rogue.",positive,en

I was trying to order my burrito without onions, and she kept saying ""okay"" and ""yes"" and nodding at everything I said. I would ask her questions and she would say ""yes"" and press buttons on the register. It took me a few minutes to realize she had absolutely no idea what I was saying. 

Aside from that, my burrito wasn't bad... nothing special though. The beans were from a can, the guacamole wasn't fresh (I doubt anything was), everything is cooked in or made of lard, their chips are flavorless and kinda stale, and they are seriously lacking any sort of salsa.

4,"""If the melting pot exists, the cheeseburger may well be its most palpable product; to take a bite of it is to take a bite of history...""

-Elizabeth Rozin, Primal Cheeseburger

Who could argue with that statement? Checked out Delux Burger today; Delux is a burger joint that gets some serious buzz and numerous Best Burger awards from the local media. They are also a late night favorite since they serve food until 2 AM. This gives them street credit in my opinion.

The mystery dining companion, otherwise known as L. joined me for this burger excursion this evening; we arrived around 10:00 PM for a late supper. The seating is a bit cramped in the dining room and the patio. The Delux menu is very nicely limited, meeting my personal rule for just do what you do best. We both ordered the signature entree, the ""Delux Burger""($9.5), starring a half-pound of freshly ground Harris Ranch beef; supporting cast includes a toasted demi baguette topped with Maytag and Gruy√®re cheeses, sweet caramelized onions, applewood smoked bacon and organic arugula. We also ordered the Combination Fries ""a la cart"" ($6) which came out before the Burgers. The fries were fantastic! They were served in a mini shopping cart (making them easy to share) and included french and sweet potato fries. Two sauces were also included with the fries, a standard ketchup and a house aioli which resembled a thousand island type sauce with some kick. 

The burgers came out shortly after the fries. They were impressive looking before we took the first bite - robust in size and the beef was perfectly cooked. Delux recommends to order their burgers at medium rare allowing them to showcase the juiciness of the beef; L. and I ordered our burgers medium and they were prepared perfectly. As we bit into these works of art, the beefy goodness oozed wonderful flavor onto our palate. The beef truly is the star of this show, however supporting cast complements it nicely without taking away from the magnificent flavor of the beef. This burger really hit the spot.

I was able to command and conquer this burger, however L. was only able to master one half and took the other half home. Adam from Man Vs. Food would have been so disappointed with her. A few other good factors that Delux offers: Good service, fantastic beer selection, which are primarily microbrews from across the country, and reasonable prices. If Delux has a weakness, it's an atmosphere that's a bit trendy and possibly even slightly pretentious, but the burgers are so good that it's overruled.

Overall, a fantastic experience... and another bite into burger history.",positive,en
4,"It looked like shrimp and it taste like shrimp but it wasn't shrimp. It looked like chicken and it taste like chicken but it wasn't chicken. It was all tofu and 100% vegan AND it was all amazingly great.  Even Amy's mock pork was surprisingly very pork like and I love pork.  You see, I love meat and it's very seldom that I go a day without meat in any given deal. However, this full ""mock"" meat experience was pretty cool and enlightening.  Not only was the lil establishment very clean but the owner was super cool and informative.  Although I don't see myself converting to full veganism anytime soon, I'll definitely be back to try a few more vegan-mock meat dishes. 
Boba Juice is also my new go to place for a much needed icy cold smoothie with boba of course. I've tried a few variations and my favorite is the taro/coconut smoothie, add boba.  I swung by Boba three days in a row for a smoothie and that's a pretty solid indicator that I like the place.  Yay, I am a fan!",positive,en

4,"This restaurant reminds more of Hong Kong (where I lived for a couple of years as a college exchange student many years ago) than any place in Arizona.  The atmosphere is definitely not upscale (more like some of the Long Wongs in PHX), and may be a bit of a culture shock to some, which is why I don't recommend it for everyone (4 instead of 5 stars).  The food, however, is very authentic, though they don't always have the exact ingredients that you would find in Hong Kong.  The dry flat rice noodles (ho fun) is among my all-time favorite Hong Kong dishes, and this place does it right. The clay pot dishes are also worth a try - really good. (Among the Chinese restaurants that I have tried in Phoenix, the Gourmet House of Hong Kong is #2.  Number 1 is the Great Wall, which I review elsewhere.)",positive,en
2,"2.5 stars-
went to Lolo's for lunch on a Sunday- the place was nice and busy- waited maybe 3 minutes for a table.  Were seated but had to wait an additional 20 minutes for a high chair as the 2 they had onsite were being used.  Ordered the Te-Te's (2 chicken legs and 1 waffle) along with French Fries and Beans Over Rice.  Food came out with my entree about 4 minutes before my friend's did.  We were never brought out the fries or beans and rice- reason for it per the server- there was a big party (8ppl) slowing the kitchen up.

Food was good, not great, staff was very nice and hospitable. I will go back to give this place another shot- try something different on the menu as the waffles were super heavy and doughy.  Chicken was cooked to perfection- I swear I could have eaten 10 pieces!!",negative,en
3,"We really wanted to like Honey Bears. As far as BBQ goes, this was a perfectly average meal. My side salad was ok, corn was very good, pulled chicken was very dry and the roll it was on (got sliders) was store bought. No amount of sauce made the chicken juicier. Unfortunately the sauce had no character-was just sauce. While we are on that, flies were all around the sauce. My husbands ribs were ok but not very meaty. We are hitting all the BBQ joints in the area as we just moved here. We won't be going back here unfortunately.",neutral,en
5,"This place has it all. Fresh food. Vintage decor. Outdoor misting system for those uncomfortabley-sweaty summer days. Plenty of scooter parking. Beautiful shade trees (watch out for scorpions!). Oh and did I mention the food?

My favorite item by far has to be the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. Tender grilled chicken breast smothered in tangy wing sauce nestled between a toasty bun that has been smeared with blue cheese and crunchy celery. It's heaven in a bite.

Coupled with a serving of Sweet Potato Fries, this is a party in your mouth and every taste bud is invited. (Even that anti-social one on the back of your tongue that doesn't know how to dance.)",positive,en
2,"I saw this company on 2 Fix It and thought i'd give them a try. I was charged $320.00 to replace a day/night photo sensor for our front lights. Here's the breakdown...

$49.00 service call
$89.00 diagnostic fee
$199.00 no fuss price to replace the sensor (#3 on their Straightforward Pricing)

They replaced the small recessed photo sensor with one that extrudes from the side of the house. Clearly it is not the same part. WTH?!

I phoned Mr Sparky to log my complaint - they were very nice. As of now, the owner of the franchise will be calling me to discuss my options. I'll post an update on the results.

I just believe that if you are paying over $300.00 for a little photo light sensor, you should get a similar part in return. Unbelievable.

To Fix It certainly didn't do their research on this company.",negative,en

4,"Okay, judging a Vietnamese restaurant on the decor is a little jaded IMHO.  Ambience is certainly a factor when dining, and if that's your most pressing criteria you're probably not fit to go into most Vietnamese places.
Pholicious does a great job with their food-went their for lunch over the weekend and tried their oxtail pho which was very good.  My buddy had chicken & vegetable chow fun which was also delicious.  Sizable portions and the most unique serving of Thai iced coffee I think I've ever had.  Almost like a half old time Italian espresso pot on top of a coffee cup that holds the coffee and condensed milk.  You're supposed to stir this then add the contents to the accompanying glass of ice.  Unlike dummy me who just dumped it in the ice :)",positive,en
5,"My family and I ate here Saturday night.....based on the reviews of Yelp.
We were not disappointed, as a matter of fact, we were pleasantly surprised with every aspect of our evening.  When you arrive at Bobby Q's, the outside makes it feel as if you are about to walk into a dive.  However when you turn the corner and walk in the door, that is not the case.  Very nice ambiance throughout the entire restaurant. They had wonderful mood lighting! I love low mood lighting!  Our server was very friendly and helpful.  Our meals were excellent.  My husband got the Chicken Fried Chicken and I got the Top Sirloin.  We started with the corn bread, which was delicious!  I don't care if it feel apart at least it wasn't dry!  My top sirloin was cooked a perfect Medium and seasoned exceptionally well.  I really loved it and I love steak.  Surprisingly the roasted corn was one of my favorites of the night, I don't usually gobble up corn when I get it with dinner, but man, this was some heavenly corn!  My husbands chicken fried chicken was perfect.  Pounded thin, with a light crispy batter, I hate to say it, but it might have been better than Texaz Grill's chicken!  It was tasty.  My son got the oven cooked pepperoni pizza and it was a large portion for the $4.00 price tag, he even took some home.  Our food was excellent, there wasn't one thing we didn't like, the food was hot, the service was great, the atmosphere was great, we will return!",positive,en
4,"In the world of Mongolian BBQ near my work, there are 2 contenders:  Stir Fry Paradise and AJ's Mongolian (formerly and possibly partially still YC's...).  I prefer Stir Fry Paradise because it has never been incredibly packed, and their meat resembles meat and not frozen tubes of meat shavings.  The small ""bonus"" buffet offers more food if you aren't crippled by all the food you crammed into your bowl.  I like the cream cheese wonton triangles, they rock the body that rocks the party.  

Yeah, they are a little pricier if you tack on a soda.  Just drink  water and then tweet to the world how progressive and off the grid you are by not being a ""soda drinker"".  I haven't quite gotten my ""sauce mix"" down yet, but that will come in time.  That's the beauty of these places, if your food is bland then the only person you have to blame is yourself and your lack of sauce mixing artistry.",positive,en

3,"Rolling Hills is two executive courses, and great for a quick cheap round of golf.  Totally not an out of towner destination course, but a nice little local fave of mine.  The front nine is the old course, and is a bit like mini-golfing, a fun distraction.  You even get to hear the occasional strange animal sound from the zoo hidden behind the trees along a couple holes.  The back nine is a newer build, and is way more challenging and scenic.  Either way they both give a fantastic view of the valley, and it's a great place to play a quick 9 holes after work in just over an hour

Friendly staff...store is usually pretty quiet when I go in which is nice as I cannot stand crowds! Mens selection is a little skimpy .. however when I go there it's usually just to sell. On that note, they pay you 5% more of the retail value of any of your clothing than Buffalo does!

Hey it doesn't smell! Its a nice bowling alley and I can imagine spending a few hours here like I did tonight with my Phoenix Fabulous Forty Women's Club. 

The bar is very nice for a bowling alley. They even have a pool table! 
They serve decent food and cold drinks to your lanes with waiter service. 

All the lanes, screens and scoring boards are new, clean and state of the art. There's no old smelly gross carpet to be avoided either, which is classic of bowling alleys I have been in! 

Prices for rental equipment and lane use is average cost.

I took my PADI course through a dive shop before I found out about Sport's Chalet's prices.

I have been here quite a few times; it is a place my girlfriends like to come to so when I want to hang with my girlfriends and get a mani/pedi this is where we meet.  Although today I was solo:(.  The ladies here do a really good job; my manicures always last a really long time and they are really nice and accommodating.  Today I had one girl doing my pedicure and another doing my manicure... now that is what I call service!  I was out of there in a hour.  They do not have a tip line on credit or debit so bring cash for the tip.  Today I did not have cash ( i forgot)  they were so nice they said next time I come I can tip then if I want.  I came back anyway to tip them because it was so fast and my nails look great.  Oh another thing I forgot to mention is they use the hot rocks for the massage part for both the manicure and the pedicure and the callous remover is part of the cost of the pedicure.  Total for both services including getting french manicure on toes and fingers was $42.00.,positive,en

3,"I have to say I was slightly surprised when I went to the State Fair this year. Now I wouldn't go as far as saying I was impressed and it's a must for families or friends. My sister and I won free tickets to the fair and reserved seats for The Band Perry Concert off the radio and thought that was a good enough excuse to head that way. We got their around 5:30pm and it was relatively easy to find a somewhat secure parking spot (for $10). 

We went on a Wednesday so I imagine it wasn't as crowded as a weekend tournament, but this day happened to be a day where you could get in free if you bought three canned food items to donate to St. Mary's Food Bank. Good way to save on admission. I think I would be a little irked if I had to pay $10.00 to get in on top of cost for game/ride tickets and food and everything else. The other nice thing about going on a Wednesday is most of the games and rides are half the # of tickets or 4 tickets per game/ride (not all of them but the majority). 

Lines were short and you didn't have to wait much for anything. They sell some pretty strange fair food - I mean I can't even imagine eating fried butter, but I did have a fried Reese's Peanut Butter Cup which was pretty good. 

We went around 7:00 into the Veteran's Memorial Coliseum and it was easy to enter and pretty full once we got inside. We got moved to seats closer than our original section. This is a one time adventure for me and I am glad we went but the fact that it was pretty much free is what made it appealing.",neutral,en

The food kept us talking about the tastes and combinations far into the night.

Small/shared plates will fill you up quickly.  The Hamachi Crudo was a fresh, light starter with peppers, fennel and sea beans to fire up your appetite! Grilled asparagus and a delicate, cheesy risotto were great sides but the smoked beef rib was a taste sensation.  Sweet and savory, smoky and succulent, sticky and sumptuous! Bleu cheese grits and grilled peaches were the perfect pairing.  ahhhh, sigh.  I think I'd pass up the tater tots and save room for something else.  

This restaurant is just what Phoenix needs.  Close to the ball parks or walk off your dinner in an invigorated downtown, Blue Hound Kitchen is a great addition to the energy.",positive,en

5,"I honestly have only positive things to say about Postino's since every one of my visits here has been very pleasant. From the valet who is running his ass off to the food and everything in between, this place does it all right! If you go here hungry, you should know that your options are basically a panini, a salad or some bruschetta. I've had a little bit of everything and for the value and quality you can't go wrong the the bruschetta. I recently determined my favorite to be the ricotta, dates and pistachio but a close second is the salami and pesto.

Wine by the glass can be a bit steep so if you're planning to stay for a bit and can agree on a style with your company, you might be better off getting a bottle. A bottle is pretty much 3x the price of a glass so you end up getting 1 1/2 glasses extra. Bonus!

Someday, I'll actually take advantage of their $20 deal for wine and bruschetta!",positive,en

Food is good but not great.  Not high-end Mexican but decent ingredients put together with care.  I highly recommend asking about their specials.  They are thinking about what they prepare and have some excellent dishes they have created themselves.  The spicy roast pork is very good - as an example.

I usually opt for a cheese crisp with green onions and green chilies and a side of guacamole (which is always yummy but pricey) and I still pay for all that $15 plus what ever we are drinking.... I love the overly rustic atmosphere, but it really could use some updating and maybe a good scrub....

First off, the energy in this place is lacking.....the food isn't anything to write home about and seriously, I could of made better in my own kitchen.  The SPINACH CON QUESO DIP was ok, but the chips that came with it were stale and the CHICKEN AVOCADO SANDWICH was dry and came out like a burger not a sandwich......The Skinny Margarita's are horrible and lack tequila and the bartender doesn't know how to make a good martini to save his life!
As for the staff?  Well our first waitress was a little too friendly and just about sat in my husbands lap....oh, I know that a little flirting comes with the job and is what you do to get a better tip, but come on honey, how did you know that I was not paying for that dinner?  If I was, the only tip you would of gotten would of been a 'back off a little on the whole, I have daddy issues in flirting'!  I have to admit though, once we changed seats after our dinner and went into the lounge area of the Bungalow, our waitress knew exactly what she was doing when it came to her job and her flirting was exceptional.....she knew how to work it while still being a classy lady, and I respect that! 
As for the clientele of this place, it's a younger crowd full of loud drunk guys at the bar watching the football game.  What you expect in a sports bar.....Outside the crowds quieter and more tolerable.

While That's Amore gelateria is located in a strip mall (what in Arizona isn't?), the taste and style are pure Italian. Credit the fact that it is owned and operated by two sisters and their husbands who emigrated to Scottsdale from Italy. The murals of Italian cities on the back wall were even painted by their father, who they brought to the valley for just that purpose. How cool is that?

First of all it has the BEST happy hour!  I was introduced to the restaurant's best items during happy hour when it was less expensive to be adventurous.  My absolute favorites are the Sweet Onion Salmon, Salmon Carpaccio and Shishito Peppers.  The Sweet Onion Salmon's sauce is to die for, the Salmon Carpaccio is soft and creamy with a nice kick of wasabi and the Shishito Peppers have the most amazing garlic-type sauce!  I usually order the peppers with a side of white rice and drizzle the sauce on it for a more filling meal.  

Other favorites are the RAckin shrimp, Uchi No Salad and Vegas Roll--basically any of the happy hour items are great!

1,"AWFUL!!! HORRIBLE!!!!!
IT was just HORRIBLE experience! 

I made an appointment for mani and pedi and came in Friday morning at 10 am. There was only one lady working there (no bage with her name) She said she could take me earlier than 10. I said it's fine, she asked me  to pay cash right away! only cash she said!! And ask me to go to ATM to get cash! I was surprised, but didn;t think anything bad. Later I realized that I didnt get any reciept so she just put my cash in her pocket because there were noone else there at that time.

She started with manicure and it took her less than 10 min!! everything was done in 10 min! She didnt even the nails, didnt remove the cuticule -she just polished the nailes with an old file. Her work was so nigligent in everything! Nail polish was all around the nails and my finger tips. I suggested her to correct it and remove an extra polish around and she did it only on few nails, repeating all the time :""Pretty? Yes?"" It was so far from looking pretty!

I'm a polite person by nature and never argue, but here it was just awful! And I payed her first together with the tips so she took 45 bucks from me

Her pedi was not better at all!! She was always in a hurry! She didnt let my nails  dry and started putting my shoes on me! I warned her that it must have been not done yet, but she didnt listen, she wanted to get rid of me as soon as possible, so all the nails went messy!!!

5,"I went there last night with bf to celebrate our anniversary. After pre-yelp, we knew what to expect as to prices, so it wasn't so much of a shocker.

To the food, we concur with almost everyone here. It was impeccable! We ordered the ice tower for 2 and thought that it was very well presented. Ours came with 3 appetizers (raw oysters, crab claws and dungeness crab) so it wasn't too high. They are all fresh. Growing up I used to go to the beach quite often just to have fresh crabs, so I know what those taste like. And for 6 years living in the desert, Mastro's is the first and only one in AZ to deliver that.  

For main course, I got Ivory Salmon ""Oreganata"", bf got Swordfish blackened. I am quite picky when it comes to fish, and bf isn't exactly a fish person, but both of our dishes ""surpassed expectation."" I couldn't say much about swordfish except it was fresh. We had the same dish 2 weeks before at somewhere else, it was nowhere near as sweet and fresh as the one at Mastro's. It was my first having Ivory Salmon, it was sweeter, and white (hence the name) than normal salmon we get around here. Mine was good size portion, firm to the touch, but melted in the mouth. The flavor was subtle enough to enjoy by itself, or you can add one of the sauces provided. One of my favorite sauces of the night I think was made of minced tomatoes and olives, came with the main course.

Sides were Lobster Mash and Snap peas. I didn't really care for snap peas as I can make them at home. But lobster mash is a MUST for those who go there. I'm not sure how they prepared it, but it felt like mash potatoes made with lobster bisque (instead of water and milk) and added lobster chunks. It was much more flavorful and creamy than a normal mash potatoes. It was big enough to share and take home. One thing though, it hardened up after sitting out for awhile, so I'm not sure if microwave could make it all fluffy again after 1 night in the fridge.

Drinks there are amazing, from the presentation, to the taste, and definitely the amount of alcohol in each drink. We decided to go with cocktail drinks rather than wines because of other yelpers' reviews. Total worth it!!!

The service was amazing. We had Robert. We pretty much asked him for recommendations for everything, yet he was nice about it and very knowledgeable. Next time we go back, I would definitely ask for him again.

We didn't order dessert since they gave us a dark-chocolate ""Happy Anniversary"" cake with the letters written, also, in chocolate. The overall experience was 4 3/4, just because it was a bit difficult talking to each other. The acoustic of the room wasn't very good and it got loud. Didn't see much of cougar/manther scene as we were in the dining room. And maybe it was during weekdays, we saw lots of ""expense account"" people though",positive,en
4,"The drive to the top is really fun, and the view is worth it.

I really enjoyed it here, but there's too much freakin broken glass on any of the trails down near the main shade/view structure that you should realy avoid it if you have your dogs with you and stick to the more wilderness areas.

30 other reviews = TLDR (i just learned that one, see how I'm applying) so I'd rather be brief and useful than wordy and redundant.

I did read Chuck R's review, and I have to say, I wish I knew more of the nooks and crannys that you do, but I can tell you that if you want to explore the Western reaches of the park, do so by starting in the center or east, and not to bother with approaching from the West side of the mountain range itself.  All you'll find out there is a bunch of paranoid, possesive property owners who didn't stop to think that if they chose to own a home on a ribbon of private land that surrounds public land and restricts the public from getting to their public land, then they'll have to endure a little bit of traffic from said public.  Here's a clue for any of those property owners, whether you're on South Mountain, Piestewa, wherever....the guy sneaking around is the one you call the cops on for being a suspicious trespasser, not the guy driving a family suv with 2 dogs in the back, who calls you from the street as he sees you in your driveway so he can ask directions on how to get to the park entrance so he doesn't have to bother you nice people in the residential neighborhood anymore driving around here.    ah, duh.",positive,en
4,"Not too much to add. But must try nevertheless. 

Second time here, well technically third but the first time it was on a Sunday at 3pm and it was closed. Closed, 3 pm Sunday? That made me a grumpy mumpy, but on the second time/third time when it was open, I was pleased. I mean, Sunday at 3 pm and closed, YIKES!! Where will hipsters look cool and surf on their Mac Books for free or students study for hours while only spending $6? 

Went yesterday (third time) for a little of the old in and out, or in some circles known as a spot of coffee. Nice coffee shop, I didn't eat anything but had a lovely triple skinny vanilla latte and picked up a bag of their espresso. 

I love coffee art and my skinny vanilla latte had a touching and semi-inspiring flower shape on it. I immediately rushed home and scoured You tube to learn to make coffee art with my espresso machine. Oh, they make it look so easy, we tried it and are beginning to make progress, (I made the shape of an ink blot on my latte) oh to think some day my latte will have intricate bird shapes and strange Aztec images on our homemade espresso drinks, alas inspired by Lola's. 

PS. Coffee art is a lot harder than they make it look on You tube. 


To sum it up, I found it to be a nice caring touch that you don't see at many other coffee shops. 

The shop itself is really set up nicely and in perhaps one of the best central corridor locations possible. Off the light rail and in the heart of Cen Pho, it is strategically perfect. 

The down side you ask? 

The hours are Wimpy, Wimpy, Wimpy. One would expect later hours with a central-downtown-hip-urbane -Coffee shop of this caliber? 

I think the hours are indicative of an inherent conundrum to what ails Central Phoenix as a whole (although improving). Things are just not open late enough to be considered a World Class City. Hopefully, they will have longer hours as time goes on? 

Otherwise, I am a fan of Lola's!",positive,en

Why I'm giving three stars instead of two is that I JUST discovered their hot dogs and those are FANTASTIC. I never need to have another burger from here, I'll stick with my double doubles......but the hot dogs???? VOILA!!!!
And their soda machine is really cool too. It's touch screen so once you pick your soda, you then get to add flavors. It's really cool. If they had a soda machine on The Starship Enterprise, it would be the soda fountain from Five Guys....except that it would have to be voice command.

4,"3+ meals for $10.75? GREAT DEAL! Ask for your meal to go, so you don't have to pay 50 cents for take out box :)

How do you get 3+ meals, you might ask? PACKING & SMUSHING! First, add some meat, and use the wax paper to pack down the meat all along the sides and the bottom of the bowl. Try to avoid empty spaces in between every piece of meat. Then add your vegetables, and smush it all down with the wax paper with each layer of veggies you add. Make sure to add enough meat and veggies so that your have a flat surface up to the brim of the bowl. Add lots of green onions for extra flavor.

I recommend using the wheat noodles, because you can create a taller mountain of noodles and it's healthier!

Advice for the sauce: ADD LOTS OF IT. Since you're now a packing queen/king, you can't use the recipes on YC's wall, either double up or triple up.

Ask the nice Mongolian BBQ chefs to add pineapples and cilantro, and then when they finish cooking up your food, add some sesame seeds for that lil extra somethin somethin!",positive,en

2,"I want to give the Cornish Pasty Company another star, but I can't quite do it...

The pasties I order are REALLY good... They have a fine beer selection (including Mickey's Big-Mouths) and a few cocktail options... Most of the sides and desserts are pretty solid.

I tend to stick with and very much enjoy the more traditional pasties like The Oggie, and the Cottage Pie (OK, OK... I love the Royale with Cheese, too). However, some of the ""premium"" pasties like the Pesto Chicken and the Salmon pasty are a bit funky to me. 

Even that, I can write off to personal preference.

What really keeps the CPC from getting another star or two is the restaurant itself. 

It's a long, narrow space, 75% of which is divided by a bar. Seating is along the wall or at the bar, with a few larger tables in the back. 

On the other side of the bar from the customers is where ALL of the restaurant operations take place; cooking, cleaning, prep, and bar. If one is sitting at the bar, this intersection of consumption with infrastructure is often a bit too much like watching sausage being made. 

I don't really expect a fine dining experience at a place like the Cornish Pasty, but I really don't need to hear the dishes crashing into the sink and i don't need to see all the potential for cross-contamination (food preparation right next to the dirty dishes and raw meat right next to the beer glasses). 

My worst experience was arriving late and sitting at the bar while they were cleaning the ""kitchen"" area and still serving food. It was really noisy, the refrigerator light kept blinding me, and the smell of cleaning chemicals was so strong that it made it impossible for me to even think about enjoying the pasty. I walked out after about 4 bites...

I've wanted to go back several times, because I do enjoy the food and beer options, and finally went back last Friday. The food was as good as it's ever been but the environment will still make me think 2 or 3 times before heading back.

Maybe I'll just have to take advantage of their take-out and stop at Tops liquor on my way home for the Hoegaarden...",negative,en

Because of this, and because the best thing I've ever done for myself was to buy an electric Hamilton-Beach water kettle, I drink TEA. All day. Loads of it. Teavana is MUCHO EXPENSIVE, though I adore it. I learned of the Tea District through somebody's ad and like them very much as well. But, I had no idea we had a genuine tea company in Phoenix. And because of HomeRun, I was allowed to buy THREE vouchers. And because DragonFly is so awesome, they let me use all three to buy tea online and have it shipped to me all at once to avoid huge s&h fees. It should be here any day, and I can't wait to try their Cab(ernet) against Teavana's Opus Rouge. I love red heavily tart, fruity teas. It doesn't matter to me if there is no white, green, or black tea in it. In fact, I prefer it to just be the fruit. I drink it hot, and then as it cools all day in my tea pot, I keep refilling and either warm each huge travel mug with lid in the microwave, or drink it room temp, or even add some ice if it is particularly strong. I can EASILY drop $150 at Teavana, or $120 at Tea District and just touch on what I most want. With your three vouchers worth $60, I got to try two bags of every flavor I most wanted, except Peach (as they are out of it, but Holly wrote me several times and made recommendations based on what I had in my cart).
 
I know I will love it, and go back to order the Peach when it is in stock again. Thank you so much for finding a local treasure and making it accessible.

It was a beautiful day and since she was such a good girl in the car with me and at my afternoon meeting, I wanted to reward her.  Rather than travel out of our way to go to Chaparral Dog Park (our usual dog park destination), I remembered seeing this place, specifically the fenced in / off-leash area, and we swung by.

It was just after 4pm, and there were a handful of dogs there, and more were coming the longer we stayed.  It's a lot smaller than Chaparral, and the grass is not the healthiest I've seen... Unfortunately, there were several areas that owners didn't clean up after their pooches too.  (Come on, owners, you give the rest of us a bad name!)

Anyways, we had a nice 30 minute visit... Minnie sniffed out a few other dogs from behind and then they returned the favor to her.  Don't you love how they socialize with each other?!  Too cute.

Anyways, will this become our dog park of choice? No.
Is this a viable option if you're in the area? 100%.",neutral,en

5,"Let me begin by telling you about my horribly debilitating fear of going to the dentist.  It's epic.  Weeks before an appointment I start having nightmares.  Thinking about sitting in the dental chair makes me break out in a cold sweat.  I require nitris oxide for a simple cleaning. The sound of the drill is enough to make me want to claw my face off.  Basically, every visit has been the worst experience ever for the past 30 years....

Enter Dr. Marcia Blazer.  I read about her online when searching for a local dentist here in Scottsdale.  I literally googled ""dentists for anxious patients"", and her name popped up.  Her website appeared too good to be true.  They offered nitris (plus), offered non invasive options for dental procedures (double plus), and offered a staff used to accomodating those with a healthy dose of dental fear.

I went in for my first visit (a cleaning and exam), and I was amazed at how comfortable they made me feel.  They were warm and friendly, and put me at ease immediately.  During the cleaning, my least favorite part is always when they use the scrapy,pointy torture device to stab off all the plaque at the gumline.  How happy was I when they used an air abrasion tool instead...felt like a cool stream of water on your teeth, and BAM, they're clean!  They were so calming, that when I was informed that I had 2 cavities, I didn't even have a panic attack at the thought of coming in.

Fast forward two weeks to my filling appointment.  I had requested nitris (hey, I was feeling better but still SUPER anxious), which they had all set up in the room for me when I walked in.  Now here's my favorite part.  As I sat in the chair, the assistant brought over two big boxes full of dvd's and asked me what movie I would like to watch during the procedure...What?? So I picked a lighthearted comedy (50 First Dates).  I was then given noise eliminating headphones to use (goodbye horrible drilling sound), nitris (hello happy gas), and a few hand signals to recognize if I was supposed to open or close my mouth.  And we were off!  She didn't try to maintain conversation (soooo annoying when dentists do that), and before I knew it she was done and I was disappointed because my movie wasn't quite over!  I was even told that had my dentist not needed the room I was in for another patient, that I would have been welcome to stay and just finish the movie!

I have had several interactions with this office since then (regarding billing and follow up), and every time it is a pleasure to deal with them.  I highly recommend this office to anyone!",positive,en
4,"I am just providing a review for the Mother and Infant Care Department only, since my wife has just had our second baby delivered here.

We really enjoy our stay at this hospital. The facility is very clean and nice. Room are good size with shower box inside bathroom, so you can take shower during your stay and care for the mom. During the stay, Mom and the caregiver are entitle to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner for free. All you have to do is call and place your orders. The foods are quite quality and the portions are decent. I am really impressed with this.

The nurses are all knowledgeable, caring, and nice. They are always there when you call them and need them. Since this is our second child, it works out perfectly that the nurses only come by when we call them or when they do their routine checks. So, the rest of the time you are left alone to rest. The hospital where my first child was born was different. They let lots of interns and students come to our rooms all the times for training, so we were constantly bothered. 

However in my opinion, if it is your first child, you may find that having people around all the time could help you not to worry too much (since we all know nothing when the first child come).

The reason I didn't give this hospital 5 star is just because our discharge was taking so long. We thought we would be out by 11 AM, but we didn't get out until 3 PM... They said that because it was on Sunday.  I think it make sense.

Overall, I do recommend this hospital for any new mother.",positive,en

The cornbread they bring to your table is really yummy but sometimes you have to ask for it to make sure that they bring you some.

My normal concerns with such eateries--will the food be maintained at a proper food-safe temperature, is this seafood fresh, how long has the sushi been sitting out, will I be able to make it home before my intestines rupture--dissipated because Hoa knows good Asian cuisine. She is, of course, born to Vietnam and world traveled. 

Let's start with my happiest aspect about HKGB: the sushi. No, it's not the best sushi in the Valley, but they make it fresh for you on site. You can stand there and watch it being make, grab a soup or something else to munch on, or just sit at your table and chat awhile. Afterwards, you can head back for more sushi or veer over to the more traditional offerings of a Chinese buffet: sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, crab legs. 

Now let's review the not-so-shiny aspect: the price. Yes, it seems a little steep that we paid about $25 per person with tip (and I made only two rounds) but when you factor in the 2 hours we spent there, grazing, catching up, grazing, passing Lisette's daughter around, grazing and making plans to keep in touch, it's really not such an outrageous amount to pay.

Also, there is a plethora of treats and toys for your furry friend as well.  The small animal foods section has a few small bags of hay, some treats, pellets, and toys.

3,"I enjoyed my nights here.  The facilities are clean and very well maintained.  Housekeeping staff is fantastic also.  They were not intrusive and they were hospitable.  

However, the ONE thing that bothered me was the reception staff.  I was mistreated.  I say this because I asked the reception staff a question about the pool hours and the response I received was ""Are you a guest here?""  Followed by ""because we get a lot of people around here...""  While that response is completely understandable, I must point out that I checked in an hour earlier with the SAME staff at the desk.  This may be me sounding like a self-centered, remember me-type of person, but no.  I felt that the receptionist was categorizing me because of my age and because of my look.  I guess I just look like the type that would crash into a hotel pool?  Mind you, this Residence Inn is adjacent to the Mayo Clinic and desert land.  Yes, the only two things around walking distance are this hotel and the hospital.  So apparently, this hotel pool must be the hot spot for pool crashers.  Must be all the sickly patients that want to take a dip in the pool.  

Then on the same occasion, the same reception staff told me that they did not have a bottle opener at the desk.  There is a small convenient store next to the reception desk that sells wine, beer, water, soda, snacks, etc.  I purchased a beer and asked them if they had a bottle opener so I could drink my beer by the fire pits and they said no.  It had been misplaced.  Some time later, the nice gentleman that helped me open my beer got beers at the reception desk and somehow, they magically had a bottle opener.  Strange how they had one for him, but not for me. 

Regardless, I was a bit bummed that the reception staff was childish and rude to me.  I felt like I was individually singled out to be discriminated against.  It's a shame too because I love my Marriott Rewards card.  

The rooms are large here.  The elevator takes forever!  I suggest that the hotel adopt elevator music to distract the sluggish speed of that elevator.",neutral,en
5,"Restaurant 28 is a solid hole-in-the-wall that's pretty easy to miss, but it's definitely worth a stop.  On my visits I've gotten brisket and other barbecue, and my friends swear by the chicken and say it's some of their favorite chicken in the Valley.  The hush puppies are great- the greens are good too.

Another review said it well when they said this place doesn't underseason food.  Every time I've gone it hasn't been bland- it's got some great flavor and it's tasty stuff.

It's in a pretty dull area where there isn't much else to do, or I'd be out there more often.  It's a tiny place too but I've never been in and had it be hugely busy or busy to the point that waiting was crazy.

Definitely recommended, and I hope they're able to grow and thrive.",positive,en

If you like loud sports bars where the patrons get into the game this is the spot to go. Plenty of fun to be had.

4,"A perfect way to top of an exotic shopping experience at 99 Ranch.  The Taiwan Express has photos of many (not all) of their dishes. Very authentic.  

Also try some shaved ice for desert (brought me back to Singapore!).  My kids love the shaved ice, though they are more used to Asian foods than most kids.  

Note that the Buffet section (to the left) is better than any mall food courts, and may be more tame for some taste buds.  

AND - in between the buffet and Taiwan Express you can buy a whole roast duck for about $12.50, which they will cut up for you.  Be sure to buy some Plum Sauce (elsewhere in the store) for a sweet dipping sauce for the duck (yummy!).",positive,en

My husband ordered the linguine and clams which he said was just ok. My stepson had the crab and shrimp cannelloni which he enjoyed. I really liked my eggplant Parmesan. It is the best egg parm I have had at a chain. The sauce is fresh tasting which huge chunks of garlic.

So many other places make a similar dish, but much better. They also serve really good rolls with butter that come out nice and warm. The texture of the rolls are a little unexpected. I think they use tapioca flour as their base. I will definitely be back to enjoy their main dining cuisine.",positive,en

2,"I cook better pasta than them, and I am not much of a cook.

The pasta I had (I believe it was a marinara dish with penne pasta) was awfully bland.
Sauce didn't mix well with the pasta either.
The texture of the pasta was funky, hanging out on its own.
If I wanted bland pasta I would buy a can of Presto and penne pasta, boil them together and add some water :p

The server was attentive enough to notice and brought me more sauce.

I did like the service and how they had the giant white piece of paper and crayons on the table so I could doodle while I waited.

The waitress was very attentive and friendly.

Appetizer: calamari was yummy.

3,"Well, it dropped a star for me, and I'll tell you why. Eaten there probably 20 time in the last quarter. I've had it all; All you can eat sushi, bowls, desert, beer. Ate alone, ate with Sandra K, ate with son and family (including 3 year old grandson who plays drums with the chopsticks) had a party of 12 there.

Service....slow on Saturday for the AYES, otherwise I can't complain. There are some ""bright"" spots. First, it's close to my neighborhood, a start and there is more than sushi and that is helpful when you have non-sushi lovers with you. The bowls are very good and you can order them in the heat index you like. Funny names to them as well, like the ""Exit Wound Bowl"" or ""The Classified Bowl with this description;Don't Order this Bowl"".

Squid Salad is great, great, great! Calamari, ok. Hey they put a lot of thought into their beer selection and that is cool. And their dessert sushis are very unique.

As for the sushi....I now have way too many sushi restaurants to try and they are all falling over themselves for your business. Sushi has become really ""hip"" lately but there will be a fall out in this category as the economy continues to slow and people, let's face it, are pulling back. This is not a place for a sushi purist, but give me good food, a cool gathering place (close to my central Phoenix abode) and I will be there. Sushi has got to get better for me to rate higher and ""earn"" my business.",neutral,en
1,"Can I tell you how much I despised Fate with all its pretentious, snooty bullshit? I should have known the second I realized that Bliss/reBar was in the same building that it was probably tainted from all the leftover evil.

And so it is. We showed up and the restaurant was practically empty. There is no hostess or even a hint of one. We stood there for many minutes on end before even being acknowledged by one of the many servers who were rushing around (perhaps serving to invisible people? The place was dead.). We were told there was a 15 minute wait, or we could eat on the patio. Um, it's 40 degrees...  AND THE PLACE WAS DEAD. I guess we'll wait. We go back outside because there is zero point zero extra room to stand. The server comes back out and says they have two large parties coming in an hour, but we can sit inside now if we can be done in 45 minutes. That's sure inviting, isn't it.

So we hustle on inside and make some hasty selections. $9 faux comfort food shit like gourmet mac and cheese just offends me, so I go with the veggie sandwich. That sounds innocuous enough, right? The food came out straightaway - too fast for a burger to be cooked medium well, like my companion ordered. Sure as shit, she cut into it, and it was bleeding and mooing all over the place. My ""veggie"" sandwich arrives and it looks like a Filet-o-Fish from hell, some huge block of something unidentifiable due to extreme deep-frying. I couldn't help it - I asked the server what the hell it was. 

Eggplant.

Ohhhhkay then. 

It was like trying to eat a deep fried brick between two pillows. Impossible. The pretzel bread, while yummy, is totally unyielding. Only Jenna Jameson can fit that thing into her mouth. My companion was suffering a similar fate with her bleeding burger. There was mayonnaise and shredded cabbage and boiling hot eggplant juice going everywhere and it was goddamn ridiculous. Neither of us got through even a half of our sandwiches. I wolfed down the side salad just to get something remotely healthy in there after the onslaught of grease, although I almost choked on the buckets of sugar syrup they call salad dressing.

So, while we are attempting to recover from this mess, the server goes MIA. You'd think if they were trying to hustle us out of there, we'd get a damn check. Nope. No. Nada. Had to chase someone down and ask for it. When it finally came, there wasn't even an itemized receipt, so even though the total seemed a little low I couldn't check it out. I was so over the whole experience at the point I didn't even care. I left a shitty tip and we escaped to the bar next door, where the cute bartenders gave us some free drinks and we sucked down innumerable $3 vodka specials for the next four hours.

Besides, these chips are real.  Not some gigantic bag of factory chips laying on some heating tray in the back.  They killed those tortillas this morning, in boiling oil.  Seriously, the first bite not capture your imagination but you'll slowly find yourself wondering why you can't stop eating them.

They have daily specials, my favorite of which is the chicken mole which is Thursdays I believe.  I'm also a sucker for Friday's chille relleno.

5,"Postinos a spot for high rollin' winos. 

You woke up at noon and had breakfast during lunchtime, so the next logical step is to have lunch food during dinner time, with some wine. This is where postino's comes in. 

The menu is full of salads, Paninis, bruschetta and a few apps. There is a large by the glass wine menu ($8-$14) and hipster cool ambiance. 

Service here is great, the patio is quite nice with heaters, a fire place and even a few patio furniture loungers.  Great for a date, hanging with friends and conversation.

We started with the Bella Postino $9 Crustini with a artichoke dip and a hummus. The artichoke dip was great as any fat laden dip would be. The humus was ok but I am a hummus  snob.

For our main we had the Vegetarian Panini ($9.75) It was good and moist with hummus roasted tomatoes olives and an artichoke spread, the focaccia bread was well toasted from the Panini press.

We also had the mediterranean  salad 8.75 which is a romaine salad with copious amounts of feta. Pretty good as I do like cheese but maybe not as healthy as one would want from a salad.

For desert we had a crem burle, simple not to sweet and well executed a classic.",positive,en
2,"My wife and I had reservations there last night.  Poor choice! Not a bad place to eat, but a terrible dining experience. 

Parking was an issue. Despite our early reservations, the only parking available was in the next lot over. One had to traverse an earthen embankment and a grubby alley to get to the place. Tell your companion to wear something other than high heels!

I dislike places that serve olive oil in place of butter with one's bread. I know it's fashionable, but it gives an impression of economy. That's fine for Macaroni's Italian Grill, but detracts from the tone of a place with Tarbell's pretensions. I'd prefer it if they'd serve both, or at least give one a choice. 

The soup of the day, potato and leek, was of delicate flavor but redolent of Potato Buds. Could it be possible that they're making this stuff out of a dehydrated product? The Caesar salad starter was a nonentity, and might have been improved by a little ground pepper, which wasn't offered. 

My bride was mightily impressed by the grilled salmon....some of the best she'd ever had, she said. The effect was somewhat dissipated by the peculiar potato product offered as a side. If you like to peel off and eat the crust around the edges of a pan just used to bake scalloped potatoes au gratin, you'll like this stuff. 

I had the pork chop, which was very good without being memorable. It's served with a side of what they claim to be 'wild boar bacon' and unidentified greens. The pork, independently, was bland and without much character; but spear a bit of pork, add to the end of your fork a fragment of bacon, and then a green or two, and the dish is much improved. 

Dessert was uninteresting. The sorbet was of the store bought variety....and not top shelf stuff, either....and the apple tart was bland and as dry as if it been left in the oven overlong. 

The ambiance of the place leaves a lot to be desired for a celebratory experience. It might work for a business meeting, but it ain't no place I'd care to take a date, ever again. The dining room is crowded and noisy, making conversation difficult and at times impossible. The tables are too close together and I had to endure a face full of server's butt whenever he waited on, or cleared the dishes of, the folks at the table neighboring ours. 

I suppose I've saved the best....or the worst....for last. I haven't been as rushed by the waitstaff at a meal since my experience in an Army mess hall at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina. The place is being run as a money making machine and that means that they are trying to turn over tables as many times as possible in an evening. Services is overly rapid and one feels pressured to finish up and allow the waitstaff to get the next course on the table. The object, of course, is to get you fed and out the door, freeing up a table for another party. My wife resorted to the tactic of picking up her fork when she saw the bus-guy approaching....otherwise he'd be on us to clear the plates containing food over which we were tarrying, in his opinion, overlong.

The check was presented to us the moment it was ascertained that we had completed dessert but before the plates had been cleared. I returned it asking that she bring it on AFTER we'd finished our coffee. Which, by the way, hadn't been offered, either. 

To his credit, the dining room manager did come over to apologize for rushing us, and comp'ed our coffee. He explained that ""the standard in America is to present the bill when dessert had been finished"". I beg your pardon? Not in any place I've ever dined, and I was born in Ohio.

This place seems popular enough on a Saturday night, but I certainly won't be gracing its dining room any time soon. At this price point ($175 including wine and tip for the two of us) I expect more than what was offered. 

Sorry, folks, I know this sounds like a rant, and to some extent it is. It was an important evening for us....after all, twenty years only comes once in a marriage (well, most marriages, anyway)... and we had hoped for a gentler experience.",negative,en
3,"Third time back.  This is my 9 year old daughter's favorite restaurant for special celebrations.  Maybe because the portions are sized for her.  

Just kidding.  Sort of.

Always good food.  Sometimes terrific.  But never consistently, hit the ball out of the park good.  

The bill creeps up on you.  We can't ever seem to walk out the door with less than $80-120 bill for 2-3.  

Last night, had the filet.  At maybe 5 ournces, bigger and more substantial than the last time, when I think I paid $32 for 2 ounces.  Seriously.

Last time the steak was perfect.  This time, they overcooked it, but I didn't have the heart to send it back.  So my wife ate it and enjoyed it, and I got her salmon.

Salmon was just okay.  BUT, the bed of rissoto, one of my favorite dishes, was delightfully rich and creamy.

Overall, it's not a terrible value.  And it's a cute little french restaurant.  COMPLETELY and totally not appropriate for small children, so don't even try.  Great date place.

Whatever you do, you MUST try two things:  

1) Onion Tart - it's just a slice and a side salad as an appetizer, but OH what a slice.

2) Berry Tart - the deserts are what makes this place go.  Save room.  

Remember this:

IF YOU GO TO A RESTAURANT WITH TART IN ITS NAME, AND DON'T ORDER A TART... well, what can I say.  Just don't do it.

Don't be afraid, but don't be surprised either. Keep your cool and order your dogs. Immediately start thinking about if you want fries or rings (onion rings) and be prepared for when you're called upon again. Then watch as your hot dog is mutilated in front of your eyes and what appears on your tray is what looks like a hot mess of decapitated food.

Never fear though... because it is amazing. Well worth the wait and one of the best dogs you'll ever have. My favorites here are the white hot and the bratwurst. Whenever I know I'm going, I end up salivating like Pavlov's dog for hours.

Bummer our service this time was a totally miss.  At first she was great, check came took our drink order and food at the same time (we were ready).  She checked on us after our food arrived and we ever saw her again until the bill.  We both were so thirsty, NO REFILLS.  She offered us later that she can bring our refills in a to go cup.  That is great, but I would have liked a drink with my food instead of choking it down.",neutral,en
3,"The very definition of an average brunch.  My omelet was pretty decent, and it's nice that they let you choose a bunch of ingredients if you want to.  However the breakfast potatoes are extremely weak, fairly bland and underseasoned and are probably not hand cut and prepared.  They are mixed with an uninspiring blend of green peppers.   The rest of my table seemed to feel about as enthusiastic as I did about their breakfast burritos.

The service was also pretty slow.  Despite the awesome patio and pretty good eye candy among the patronage here, this place is definitely one you can skip.",neutral,en
5,"We'll take this over Godiva any day!   The staff is always so friendly and they're always nice enough to give my kids (all 4) a sample, too.

Just make sure you have a few wipes on hand!",positive,en
4,"Valet only parking, unless you want to try parking by the bank. Last two times we weren't able to. Not crazy about their cocktails (pretty weak) but the Bloody Mary was a welcome start to our Sunday brunch. It's not listed on their menu but they have gluten free options. Tried the egg bake, pretty good. The salmon and pork chile verde are delish (love the homemade cornbread). Overall, the atmosphere and food make this a great brunch or lunch time spot!",positive,en
4,this place will kind of throw you off when you first step with the wall nic nacs and the display that sells body wash and toothpaste next to chop sticks and such but the food is surprisingly delicious.. my husband order the chicken curry friee rice with orange chicken and he loved it. i had the chicken and beef chop suey and was not disappointed. kudos to this joint could do with some spring cleaning and a little sprucing up but good all the same,positive,en
4,"I just went here for lunch and mmm, mmm, mmm, this place is sooooo good!  I had the shrimp and veggie pho and the broth was VERY well-seasoned and so delicious going down my tummy!  We also had the shrimp spring rolls, which were also delicious and very refreshing.  

My only complaint, and the reason I couldn't give 5 stars, is that only 1 out of 3 air conditioners was working in the restaurant.  And on a day in Phoenix when it's109 degrees outside, plus the heat from the pho, we were burning up in there!  We had to go get some froyo afterwards just to bring our body temps back down to a normal level!  I look forward to going back when the temps cool down.",positive,en
1,"Staff was very rude, bowling prices weren't displayed to the best of their ability, extreme bowling itself was over priced almost $20 per person. The only thing about their extreme bowling was that it was extremely hot, temperature wise. they had many ceiling fans and not one of them turned on. And the bowling equipment malfunctioned three times during our games. It was not a pleasant experience and I don't believe we'll be going to this facility again.",negative,en
5,I'm usually not a fan of indoor tanning but post baby I felt like I needed a little pick me up color. I chose this place because of their good prices- 3 tans in a lay down bed for 17 dollars. The staff is so amazing and friendly and I got a nice brown tint after a couple of sessions.,positive,en

5,"When I think Royal Palms, I think romantic getaway. A quaint yet exquisite resort, the Royal Palms was built in 1929 to emulate a colonial Spanish retreat. Colonial as in when the Spaniards were conquering the New World.  All of the historical details are presented on a frescoed wall in one of the courtyards.  

We had heard some great things about J Cook's and decided to spend a leisurely Sunday morning dining on the patio. If you're looking to be treated like royalty, you want to dine here

I enjoyed exploring the hotel after a luxe breakfast at J.Cooks.  The staff are incredibly accomodating.  What an ideal location for an intimate stay-cation!  It's a nice place to go to grab some drinks and appetizers, I will definitely be back to see what more the resort has to offer!",positive,en

4,"I'm from the East coast, so living in Arizona feels like living in the land that Chinese food forgot. George and Son's offers the closest thing to ""Chinese"" food that I have found in Arizona (yes I know this isn't real Chinese cuisine, just look at my picture). PF Changs is not Chinese food, and that is the best I have eaten before I came here. All the other Chinese food that I have found is full of MSG, and makes me sick.

The restaurant is cozy and relaxing, and the staff is very attentive. The sesame chicken is very good. I recommend asking for firecracker chicken. It is not on the menu, just ask for the firecracker pork, but with chicken. It has the right kick to it. I would NOT recommend the orange peal chicken. After eating 1/2 of my plate, I wan't to swear off anything orange for a month. I guess I needed something less sweet with a more varying taste. 

Last time I went in, I had the three amigos, which was very good. This is shrimp, chicken, and beef in a brown sauce, poured over a hot skillet plate at your table. I would recommend any of the three I mentioned.",positive,en
2,"We chose this place for breakfast this morning because of the wonderful reviews on yelp.  I was certain it was going to be one of my new favorite places. 

We entered into a brightly painted orange restaurant and stood at the hostess stand for a few minutes waiting for the hostess to finish flirting with the server and notice us.  She clearly didn't want to be there and could care less where we sat, so opted for the table in the window.  

We sat and waited and waited and waited.  Tables that were sat after us already had their drinks and they were not busy.  Finally I tried to get the attention of the hostess who was standing half asleep at the hostess stand, mouth open wide, eyes half closed.  A few minutes later we finally had a server.

Our server was not very friendly.  I don't even think she said good morning.  We ordered.  Tables sat after us already got their food and we finally got our drinks.  She bought out 2 cups of coffee, but I did not order coffee so I made her take that back. 

Our food finally arrived.  We ordered french toast which came with strawberries, bananas and a cinnamon sauce, eggs benedict with crab cakes and two orders of country potatoes. 

Breakfast was pretty good.  I enjoyed my crab cake and the cinnamon sauce on the french toast was a nice added touch.  The potatoes were not good, they had WAY too much pepper on them, I couldn't even eat them.  Gary ate a few of his after he drowned them in ketchup.

We never saw our server again.  We got a water refilled after we finished our meal.  AND THE WAIT BEGAN.  We waited and waited and waited for our check.  Tables that were sat when we finished eating had already finished their food.  We never saw our waitress. I guess we were her only table, if not I felt bad for her other tables as well. 

Finally some guy brought us our check and tried to drop it off and run, I said WAIT and gave him my card and said, ""If I don't give this to you now it may be 20 more minutes before we see someone again""

Because I didn't look at the bill first when he brought it back I didn't notice until after I paid that they charged me $12.05 for the eggs benedict when their menu actually said $10.50.  I didn't say anything...  I just left a sad tip.

We were there for OVER an hour, they had lots of empty tables, and we only saw our server once.

Gary and I always over tip, because he and his family owned restaurants in the Valley for 35 years.  He has spent a lot of time being a chef and serving tables.  We know that when food comes out wrong, it's probably not the servers fault, and things happen, so we still tip well.  TODAY, I felt like we were invisible and I have no idea where our server disappeared to for the hour.  

We drove by Over Easy, La Grande Orange and IHOP to try this place.  We probably will not be back... unless we decide to give it a second try on jazz night... I do love jazz.",negative,en
2,"Way over priced.  They replaced the valve below my toilet, the float in the tank and the small water line going from the toilet to the new valve.  It took them less than 30 minutes and my bill was just over $400.  I priced all the parts at a plumbing shop and it came out to $35,  and thats my retail price!!  They also charged me $69 just to show up at my house.  The plumber was knowledgeable I will give them that and if you really want to use these guys try and get a quote over the phone first.",negative,en

Drove up, and frankly it's not in the best neighborhood but the guy in the parking lot keeping watch over the cars in the lot with a ""Security"" t shirt on put me at ease. 

Sat down and was welcomed immediately and offered the fresh chips and incredibly hot red and green salsa.  Although, I'm kind of a pansy when it comes to hot and spicy.  I Just ate the chips plain and they were wonderful.

Had the Chicken Mole Enchiladas which were undeniably the best I've had.  The mole sauce was perfectly made with just the right amount of chocolate.  I have the stains all over my shirt to prove it!  The beans and rice were nice accompaniments.  

Everyone knows the traditional ""Mexican"" restaurants where you go in and order the # 13 and they're all the same right?  Rosita's Place is NOT this type of eatery.  The food is authentic as authentic comes and should not be missed.",positive,en

Service was prompt and polite.  The food?  Eh.  I had one of the house specials.  I didn't think it was very special.  I do think the waiter deserves bonus points for talking me into a half order rather than a full order.  The lemon-lime beverage was strong and sweet.",neutral,en

4,"I know its gonna sound a bit foolish when I divulge that I was actually a bit scared to enter the Roadrunner Lounge, but the truth is that I was.  Due to its lack of windows and barebones facade, I concluded that this bar had the possibility of being the sort of place where, when I opened the door, I might bare witness to a mob boss or two trying to decide what they should do with the man they just shot...  but that wasn't the case.

What I discovered was a long corridor flanked by mirrored walls and strings of multicolored lights, as well as ample seating and classic video games to boot.  The games included PacMan and Golden Tee, accompanied by a dartboard and a pool table - enough to keep the gamer in any of us busy for at least a few hours of drink-sippin.

The drinks were cheap and strong, and the tunes were decent - however the digital jukebox put a frown on my face; I hoped for a Wurlitzer.  Our barkeep was friendly and efficient, and our drinks were strong and low-priced.  I think tap beer's only two bucks, and mixers aren't too much more.

In conclusion, the next time you're feeling a bit nostalgic, and you're looking for a watering hole off the beaten path, kick a few back at the Roadrunner.  Bottom's up!",positive,en

Really good!  I also got jerk fried rice.  The beans were also very good.  Yummy in my tummy.  I really enjoyed Chino Bandido's, but don't think I could go more than once during a trip to Phoenix (I'd get very large from eating like this!).  :D  Oh yeah, if you want something more than a snack, don't just get a quesadilla by itself.  My poor brother thought the quesadilla would be huge and good enough for his dinner (thinking taqueria size), but it was pretty sad and small.  Luckily, my combo wasn't that small and I had extra food to share.",positive,en

5,"5 stars all the way. 

Let me begin by saying that I'm a big fan of the products. The store is done in very warm tones and the drinks are incredibly aromatic and these 2 things combines seem to make all my stress melt away when I step in the door. 

I'm not a huge coffee fan, but I can order some of the coffee drinks here. I'm completely unable to drink the caramel frappuccino from Starbucks, but I can't get enough of the caramel ice blended from Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf.

So now that we've established that I love the product, we can move on to the real reason this place gets a 5 star review--the staff. I've never seen anything like it. If you come in 3-7 times someone will probably know your name and might even know your drink.

Leila is the best at this. She knows peoples names, their drinks and if you come there often enough she even knows which car you drive. She'll see a regular customer's car pull up and she'll have the normal drink ready and waiting for them by the time they walk through the door. THAT is the epitome of customer service.",positive,en
5,"Absolute greatness!!!

Service: friendly

Food: TRY the faux chicken wings (I crave this)
Kung pao noodles
Vegan chilli fries

After waiting to see the manager I was directed to an employee who committed slander towards me very loudly in front of everyone in the store.

4,"Ok, so I've just come to the conclusion that it's not me....... it's YOU.

I just don't like other peoples used, worn, busted up shit. That said, I really like My Sisters Closet. I've only been in a couple of times but I know potential when I see it in the form of a $400 Louis Vuitton bag. ( I wouldn't purchase it but I liked that it was there) I did pick up a pair of designer (not sure which one, don't really care) sunglasses for $14. Sure, they are probably *gasp* ""last season's"" or whatever but I don't care. They look hot and they cover almost my entire face which is something I look for in shades.

I will be back soon to see what other goodies I can find. That $400 Louis really made me nervous though. Who has so much dough that they can just drop a perfectly good $1200 bag at consignment??........ and are they interested in adopting or marrying me...",positive,en
4,"had lunch here today outside with the girlfriend and my mother. I have to say we were pretty blown away with the size of the hummus plate, 3 pieces of pita with a good 3/4 to full cup of hummus, for under 4 bucks.
 I had the chicken pita, tasted great  had onion, tomato, cucumber, and  tzataiki, freakin awsome! my girlfriend had the gyro pita and loved it. My mom had the lamb pita and says it was awsome... unfortunantly we were all being greedy and didn't want to share our pitas. I also ordered two falafel, best i've found, crunchy outside with a crazy mixture of being dense and light, you could taste all the flavor on the front of your tongue and the spice at the back of your tongue. We'll be heading  back pretty soon I hope. 

Also Lisa I think we spotted you there sitting outside. not sure it was you since you where sitting behind me and next to some folks with their dog.",positive,en
3,"3.5 if I could, but just a 3 for now.

I really like the location and I hope more businesses open up downtown.  Their fish and chips are really really good.  A good portion too, enough to finish without getting painfully stuffed.  The beer list is decent as well, but pretty pricey for what they offer.  $5.50 for a pint of guiness?  I can get a six-pack for that.  Hopefully they start a good happy hour price - if so - I'll be back often.

I went during the grand opening and the live music was pretty good.  They ran out of guinness at about 8pm, but got another keg within the hour so it was all good.  The beer however is extremely slow.  The waitress warned us that we'll get our food before our first beer, and she was right. My friends and I all ordered irish carbombs and the waitress had no idea what we were talking about... whaaa?  So I explained what they were and she returned 15min later.  1/2 glass of guiness in water glasses, not the pint glasses.  Was probably 1/4 pint of beer and the shots were in tall shot glasses.  So tall, that if dropped in, wouldn't pass the beer level.  So we had to pour them in.  meh...

So all in all 3 stars for now.  I'll give them another shot though.",neutral,en
4,"Tucked into a strip mall, the parking lot near the grocery store still has plenty of parking.  We came on a Monday morning so it wasn't really busy and we sat promptly.  

Looking at the menu, I'm looking for unique specials and being a fan of hash browns, I went with the Wolfpack.  The food itself was nothing special.  Each individual element stands on its own - 2 eggs (I chose egg whites), bacon, cheese, and plenty of hash browns, but it was a filling meal.  I had the over easy ice so it was a nice cold coffee drink for the warm weather.  My friend had the crying pig omelette which seemed pretty good.  The decor was nice and staff was pretty nice.  Although our table was right next to another, I didn't feel like either of us were intruding upon each other.  Overall, a decent place and worth visiting again to try some of their other specialties.",positive,en
4,"I came here on a strong recommendation from a friend. After reading the reviews, I was anxious to try it out. I went on a Saturday night, half expecting it to be really busy. We were seated in about five minutes or less. Not busy on a Saturday night...made me kind of worried. 

The menu is sparse, it made ordering really easy.  Service was fairly slow considering the small amount of people in the restaurant. Refills were slow, service was kind of inattentive but not rude. Our pizza came out in about 15-20 mins. We ordered a white with garlic with pepperoni and sausage. The pizza looked and smelled delicious, but that's where it all went bad.

First off, the pizza crust was really soggy because of all the grease under the pizza. I have never ate such a greasy pizza in my life. i had to drain every single slice, it literally created a puddle on my plate. There was a significant lack of sauce on my pizza, some parts of my crust were bare, not even a hint of red on them. The pepperoni and the sausage tasted great and there was enough toppings on the pizza to justify the $2 price tag. 

The non soggy areas of crust were great, and the cheese was amazing. We ended up taking half the pizza home, the slices were filling. The pizza was better the next day, after the box absorbed most of the grease, after throwing away the pizza box, the bottom of the box was saturated in grease. I'm not sure if grease makes a quality pizza, but in this case it just made a soggy crust.

**Update** Under intense pressure I came back here and tried a white with chicken, they seriously redeemed themselves. I spoke to the manager and he insisted my last time was a fluke and should have been corrected. I would come back on occasion.",positive,en
4,"Strolling down Mill street, the bf and I were enticed with free samples of cookiez. The choco-chip cookie sample got me. It was soft and chewy and enough to get me to walk into the quaint store. There's a good amount of ice cream choices as well as cookie choices. You have the option of ordering a cookie, ice cream, or even better an ice cream sandwich. I think they also offered shakes as well. 

We chose white chocolate chip with almond cookiez surrounding mint ice cream. You'll see that these folks are generous with the portions when you get your nice round scoops of ice cream smushed between the cookiez. I really like that the cookie stays soft and chewy even when it is pressed up against the frozen ice cream. I feel like other flawed ice cream sandwiches have cookies that become either hard and frozen or crumbly.

4,"I was out shopping with my 16 year old son, and we decided to stop in and try America's. The delightful young lady behind the counter highly suggested that we try at least one thing with the pastor filling so we ordered the meal for two for $20. That comes with chips and salsa, two burritos, two tacos and two drinks The carne asada was very good...but OMG...the pastor was amazing! We just wished we had ordered the burrito with the pastor and the taco with the carne asada instead of the other way around. The sweet young thing kept checking in on us...we were there at 3 in the afternoon so it was quiet...but gosh, the young girls had just been fawning over us all day! On the way home, I looked at my kiddo and realized he's pretty darn good looking...so maybe that explains all the delightful customer service that day! Anyway, I can understand some of the complaints about it being a little pricey, but I think you are really getting a quality product and that is worth it to me.

Our dishes of Pad See ewe and Dragon noodles were great, and huge portions.   Rich flavors, well textured tofu and crisp veggies.

4,"I've not stayed at this resort, but have been here twice; once for a wedding and the other for a Lunch & Learn event.  Valet service each time was quick and the guys were professional and pleasant.  The grounds of the resort are kept meticulously clean and there were clear skies and greenery everywhere I looked; so beautiful.

Lunch & Learn (Aug 18th):

The event started a little past noon and ended a little past 3pm.  We reserved for six, but it's based on a first come, first served basis.  Two of us arrived a little after 11:30am and after paying our respective $75 fee, went to find a table that would afford us good views of the chef's station.  Unfortunately the best tables (with direct views of the chef's station) had ""Reserved"" placards on them, so we ended up with one off to the right of the chef's station.  I would recommend arriving early to grab good seats; tables are set for ten.  There are two large TV screens in the room, in case you're not able to see the chef directly.  

Our event was hosted by Chef MacMillan (gave the guests a few good laughs), with featured guest chef Kevin Binkley (owner of Binkley's Restaurant in Cave Creek).  The servers weren't obtrusive and kept our water and wine glasses full.  

We started off with a glass of champagne, which wasn't great, but was appreciated and added to the festive ambiance.  For this event, we were served three courses:  an appetizer (chilled cucumber soup), entr√©e (two-wash ranch chicken), and dessert (huckleberry semi-fredo).  Each course was paired with a different glass of wine:  John Anthony Sauvignon Blanc (white, appetizer), Andre Brunel Cote du Rhone (red, entr√©e), and Pietro Rinaldi Moscato d'asti (dessert).  I'm not usually a fan of Sauvignon Blanc (I favor Riesling), but the John Anthony won me over.  

Chef Binkley went over his background and demonstrated the process that goes with making the chilled cucumber soup (which is quite involved).  The soup, albeit a bit salty, was SO good.  Everyone raved about it, and the best part of the dish for me was the charred red onion.  The two-wash ranch chicken entr√©e was good overall; however, my chicken was a bit dry and tough to cut.  This might be a one-off thing since others at the table said their chicken was moist.  Loved the sweet potato puree and Chantrell mushrooms.  The only real complaint I had was the lack of a demo for the entree and dessert.  With that said, I can understand why the chef needed to be in the kitchen...after all, we needed to eat, right? ;P

Other highlights:
*  Live band entertained with great hits (a bit loud though for lunchtime)
*  Recipes to take home
*  Q & A with the chef (and photo ops)
*  Raffles for a few prizes, which two of my friends won (a gift box of caramel brownies and one-night stay at the Sanctuary with dinner)

Wedding (Friday, March 23rd):

The ceremony was held at 5pm on the grounds near the ballroom.  The weather was a bit warm, but not unbearably so.  The bride and groom were beautiful (so was the service), but it was a bit distracting to see people observing us from the windows of the Jade Bar, which overlooked the grounds where the ceremony was held.

After the ceremony, we took a short hike up the stairs for cocktail hour, held just outside the ballroom.  It was such a beautiful experience to have a glass of wine, nibble on hors d'oeuvres, chat with friends, and watch the sun go down (with the mountains as a backdrop).

The reception was held in the ballroom and was decorated beautifully.  The food was great, the wine and alcohol was flowing, and the live (Latin) band made for a great evening.  My friend used Sanctuary's wedding planner (and caterer) and they did a great job.",positive,en
5,"I'm a big fan of Silver Mine. I have been for a long time. In fact, I would venture to say that this is my favorite sub place. Ever. I can't quite pinpoint what is so appealing about it to me. I do know that it was a dangerous decision to decide to live within a mile of this shop. The employees are super friendly, the restaurant itself is clean, the food is cheap and oh-so-good. 

Personally, I recommend the Pikes Peak or Bust which is a veggie cheese sandwich. I love it and have turned into the type of person that gets the same thing every single time...yikes! 

P.S...They also deliver until the wee hours of the morning and it doesn't get much better than a tasty sub when you have been out and about in Scottsdale on a Saturday night :)",positive,en
4,"The newly branded Red Dragon Chinese & Mexican Food is a shiny new facade on an old favorite.  (pics of new sign, and old sign by dumpster)
Formerly known as Daily Buffet,  http://www.yelp.com/biz/daily-buffet-phoenix#hrid:3-lmRTZ9YDgPxf6I2WGfHA  they offer an extensive menu.  Whatever investment they're making in this new branding, their menu certainly looks impressive.(pic)

Their buffet is quite well-stocked for it's small size.
Whether you prefer Chinese or Spanish fried rice, they have it.  Have a few picky kids that can't decide between Honey Sesame chicken and Cheese Enchiladas?  They've got you covered.

The Mexican buffet table offers rice, beans, enchiladas, taquitos, and other rotating entrees such as marinated pork ribs or a scrumptious chicken mole, if you're lucky that day.
The Chinese area includes lots of chicken and pork options, noodles, egg foo young, etc  --  standard americhino fare.  The pork ribs were very good, if a little chewy, and the sweet & sour pork was done in the style I prefer: Instead of breaded, dry peices that you put your own sauce on, or soupy watery liquid with floating veggies and meat, this had mostly meat, maybe a few carrot and onion peices, with a crispy outside covered in thick, gooey, sticky sauce, that itself got a little crispy.  (it almost starts to remind me of a candy apple when it gets like this, which I'm sure the taste buds love, but the teeth hate!)

All is prepared well, hot, not too salty or greasy, and well replenished.
Discard Pile is usually present, but also usually small.
There were some hand-breaded onion rings that were super thick!  This thing was the size of a small donut in my hand! (pic) They have a perfectly crisped outside, with an inside akin to a hushpuppy or donut.

Mmmm, ""donionuts""....

The salad bar area left a little to be desired, and there wasn't really a salsa to dip my taquitos in.  I made a nice little concoction of ketchup, pico de gallo, and sriracha sauce which suited the task way better than I could have ever thought.
Jello squares are the only real dessert option, but if you haven't stuffed yourself full of this yummy indulgent food by that point, you really don't belong in a boofay now, do you?",positive,en

I stopped by with my children to check it out - planning to eat elsewhere because my daughter eats gluten-free, etc., etc.  Then I met Payton Curry and realized what he and the Brat Ha√ºs are all about.  Great food and a desire to serve!  Payton delivered on fantastic organic salads that were gluten, egg, dairy, and soy-free and tasted great!  And he threw in a few organic surprises.  Now I have a place to eat phenomenal Moroccan lamb hot dogs while my daughter can enjoy healthy food.  On our second trip, Payton remembered us and came out to let us know he had made some falafel (in the shape of a sausage, of course) and offered my daughter one in a salad or a lettuce wrap.

3,"After reading multiple Yelp reviews on this business, I decided to come here for the greatest hits: Pizza muffins, Calzones and Antipasto salad.

I thought the pizza muffins were interesting and a great alternative to bread sticks or garlic bread. They were loaded with TONS of sausage and ham and came with 2 different dipping sauces. Although a little greasy and re-heated, I appreciated the novelty factor.

On to the entrees, the small Antipasto salad (5.99) was absolutely filling for a one person meal. I didn't find it any different from any Antipasto salad I have tried before, but I think people love it for the dressing - which had flavor but A LOT of oil (more than half of the total dressing). The ingredients were fresh but there is nothing out of this world about iceberg lettuce and dry mozzarella. 

The calzone was larger than a newborn baby and hotter than Phoenix in the summertime. Although the corners are mostly (if not all) bread the taste was very good and overloaded with tasty insides. The spinach ham combo my friend ordered was pretty satisfying and this meal could easily be split in 2 for tasty leftovers... if you can stop eating.

I found the teenage staff to be friendly and cheery but the bathroom needs massive help. Only one stall and really unpleasant smells, the female employee who had just left the bathroom as I entered left wet paper towels on the handles of both exit doors... covering the entire area for me to hold on to and pull. Just.... disgusting, especially from an employee who should be trying to keep the establishment clean and good looking.

All in all, good but not great. Its pretty affordable so if this is your price range, I think you can make it work and still have a tasty meal.",neutral,en
5,"Visiting a friend who insisted we come to Carolina's on my first morning in town to get a breakfast burrito To Die For.

She was totally spot-on.

These delicious hand-made tortillas are fantastic!  I wish I could take a bunch back to Seattle with me, but since they're freshly-made, I'm guessing the lack of preservatives will make that a better idea than reality.

Nice and clean, easy to shop, wide aisles, no clutter in the end caps.  SO easy to shop this store.

Went in today for an advertised price on chicken that we were planning on having tonight.  Asked the meat guy if there was any more chicken left.  Was told that they were sold out.  I told him that the reason we came to his store was because of the price and we were planning on eating the chicken tonight with dinner guests.  I asked if he could sub something, and he said, ""SURE, no problem!""  Friendly, helpful, super easy.

I also mentioned that the last time we came in, I bought something with a manager special sticker on it but was charged the regular price.  The customer service guy refunded my money with no questions!  Awesome.

4,"HARISSA SPICED FRIES. Need I say more? The wine list is exceptional, and they are open late, both of which are mandatory if you're a boozy creature of the night like me.

Our server was quite attentive without being intrusive. Our wine glasses were never dry, and she instinctively sensed that it would be a three bottle sort of night and suggested additional bottles to go with our meal.

The food was of a generous proportion, so bear this in mind when ordering. My Fez Salad was fresh, crisp, and the combination of the dressing and goat cheese hit the spot. Our hummus platter was heaven-sent, and had just the right amount of garlic. The lamb kisra was also exceptional, and immediately devoured. The aforementioned Harissa fries were fiery and I often dream of them. No, really. If Fez was located in Tucson, I would gain at least ten pounds from just eating harissa fries every day. Harissa, for those of you who are unfamiliar, is a North African chili-based spice that has a lovely smoky quality. I highly recommend it!

3,"Sucker Punch Sally's is a nice place to grab breakfast on Mill.  The prices are alright and their hashbrowns are made the way I likes 'em.  Usually people serve up this mash of whatever-the-fuck but here, they grate the potatoes and serve them crispy.  The way I likes 'em.

I'm sort of burnt out on places with a 50's motif, but whatever.  I like the colors.  It's kind of cozy.

One thing that bothers me:  The name ""Sucker Punch Sally's"" sounds like something disgusting you'd head about in high school.  You never heard of a sucker punch sally?  It's when a girl....

Nah, but as a whole, it's a cool alternative to have in Tempe.  Read my review on Harlow's.  I like Harlow's, but I always get diarrhea.

The Lodge was OKAY in my opinion. For it to be in Scottsdale where everything is super expensive for no reason the drinks are pretty cheap. I had a couple of shots and a drink and spent under $20. The bartender was SUPER sweet and she knew my name by the time I came back for my 3rd drink. 

They have AH-MAZING food deals. Like, get a burger and a beer for $6. Of course it's not a top notch beer but.....who doesn't love burgers and beers??

There is music...coming from somewhere and it's always pretty legit, a good mix. 

There is like an intimate, cabin sort of corner with flickering romance lights when you first walk in if you want privacy but we usually go outside to the deck and people watch and/or play cornhole....Either way, I wouldn't say this is my favorite place ever...but I dont hate it either.

3,"Funny story about my experience at this place. My Classmate mentioned she loves this place for other reasons than my own. Yet, when we drove up it was very crowded and parking is minimal when you don't arrive early. We drove in separate cars and I called and asked her, ""are you sure there is no where else we can hang out? It is super crowded. Yet, I am so glad she convinced me to go in and check it out. I suppose you ought to experience it at least once for a night out with friends. There were many different cultures/ethnic backgrounds. I very much enjoyed the band. They played some old school R&B from Next, Bobby Brown, Prince, Cameo and that's just some of what they performed. Excellent Band! The crowd was very pleasant and fun! I had to join in with dancing and singing. 

My rating review is 3.5 stars. I would have to say that this venue is way too small for the amount of people it holds, the dance floor is super small, it's really dark and hard to move around even when you are dancing. 

The staff at Char's is friendly and I've heard the service is good. I didn't drink. So just word of mouth. 

I'm not sure if I would hang out there again. I would probably go only if I knew a friend/friends were here. That would still be a maybe. Although, I enjoyed the music, etc. I'm on the fence about Char's for some of the minuses that takes away from a place that could be so GREAT!",neutral,en

They also have an amazing bakery that offers a very large assortment of tasty treats such as black and white cookies, red velvet cake, enormous √©clairs, napoleons, and New York style cheese cake.

I'd say that my favorite thing on the menu is the pastrami sandwich, although I recently tried the Jewish Sliders after seeing them on Man vs. Food. The sliders were really good, unlike any slider I have ever had. The challah bread and potato pancake gave these sliders a very unique flavor, very tasty. I also tried the Western Sliders and those are good as well.

The atmosphere was nice for the ""jungle"" but it was so loud that I could not hear my wife talking to me. I felt that I had to scream at her to talk. Our waitress was nice but didn't check on us often. We barely understood her either because she speak loud enough. We got our drinks (ten mins later) and my iced tea was good but my wife's chocolate shake was gross. Too much chocolate syrup and it was expensive!! We sent it back so she could get water another 10 mins later. Food delivery was quick and my burger was pretty good but it was plain and $12!! Jeez, so expensive for something so plain!!! I got onion rings for an extra few dollars (they were okay but worth the extra few $$$). My wife got an extra plate of fries and they were a few bucks but they didn't give her more than ten!

When were able to finally get in, we were offered drinks, and ended up getting sweet tea, which I don't care for.  I got the smothered pork chop and two sides, the mac and cheese and the black eyed peas.

So one time ended up getting 6 (maybe a few more but the beers were going down pretty easy that night) different items.  Each one well thought out and fun to eat.  Yes, I said fun. One was cooked by us on a hot rock, and the others made us investigate each tasty bite.

4) Indoor smoking lounge!!! With a large screen TV, two tables and a lot of pleather seating, the large fan won't mean much but WOW-exciting! There is a french style door separating the lounge from the bar area where the stage is so you can still peak at the band while sucking tar.

Other notes: all bartender, barbacks, security were extremely sweet and friendly; all other patrons were either pretty chill, excited to see the band that was playing or willing to strike up conversation; tons of televisions everywhere; they had a lot of beers on tap-cheap too; this place is HUGE. In fact I would consider it a liability since there are a lot of steps connecting each section-at times I found myself balancing precariously-and that is b/c I am a klutz-wasn't even drunk...ok, not that drunk.

I'd always assumed that this area of Phoenix was (excuse me for the pun) totally dry on ethnic food, considering I had a hard time finding pho within a ten-mile radius of my parents' place in Surprise.

Anyways, I chose the pad si yew (spelling varies all over the place, I think they spell it ""phat si iew"") and my father ordered some kind of chicken cashew dish. Both were excellent, though a little more in the line of American tastes -- not as spicy, and the pad si yew wasn't cooked slightly burnt like I recall it traditionally is made -- it was pretty tasty.

The hot tea was a great companion to my meal as well.

The service was great without being too pushy, invasive, or sloppy. They always refilled my water in a timely manner and didn't interrupt my conversation with my dad. That's important to me -- that servers don't bust into your conversation with little to no consideration of personal space.

My parents had been there several times and enjoyed it, so now I see why they liked it. Oh, and their spring rolls and the accompanying peanut and hot sauces were also delicious -- not the best I've ever had but super-tasty.

The atmosphere is a little dry (what is it with this word? Sorry) but I can live with it. The booths were comfy and it's not like the place was musty or gross. Not every good restaurant needs to be chic and trendy, really.

Their menu is bar food. Burgers, Wings, Fries, and so on. The have the standard domestics on tap (Bud, Coors, Miller etc).

A lot of times they have live music at 9 or 10. If this is for you then you have the chance to see an exclusive performance since not a lot of patrons are there. However, it gets pretty loud. So if this does not sound like your thing, be aware what time it is. 

Service is pretty bad if you are in the ""restaurant"" part. The only time I have eaten at a table the bartender was also our server. Needless to say slow is an understatement.

2,"A new player in the Downtown Phoenix food scene, Bliss is a creation by the folks behind the Fez, Switch, and Ticoz empire. They occupy a buliding once occupied by Fate and Nine|05, the former of which was one of my favorite restaurants.

Entering the restaurant, we were greeted with an odor of mildew and dirty water, which isn't exactly a pleasant way to arrive into an establishment. Being the only ones seated in the small space, we were able to really examine it, and I noticed one glaring difference between the way they have it set up and the way it was set up; it feels like a cafeteria. The installation of florescent lights, heat lamps, and massive amounts of stainless steel in the open kitchen make this place feel like a lunchroom at high school. Whatever, we can deal with it. An overview of the menu showed several options which seemed like drunk food... fried everything, cheese crisps, foot long hot dogs, slider burgers, tacos, grilled cheese, etc. Apparently ""comfort food"" means deap fried grease? NO THANKS. I ordered the Braised Beef Tacos, which had the consistency of paste, but were average in taste. 

My biggest gripe with this place is the microwave (not even a turbo chef) sitting front and center in the kitchen. Look, I understand that some restaurants use microwaves (usually not good ones) in their kitchen, especially if it's a cold kitchen (which this isn't) but having it in plain view and audible in the dining room is just atrocious. I truly hope someone from the restaurant reads this and hides the thing. It made me completely lose my appetite when I saw them heating my girlfriend's rice for her chicken skewers in the microwave. yuck. She did mention she was neutral about her food. We are people who go out at least once a day for a meal and try a new place every time, so we know food. 

Everyone we encountered was nice, and the service was very friendly. Everyone seemed interested in how well we enjoyed our meal, the space, and they seemed interested in welcoming us back. Unfortunately, the place looks kind of makeshift on the ReBar side, and like a cafeteria on the Bliss side. I'm not really sure why it looks makeshift, perhaps it is just because it looks like a temporary wall in the back of the room, or because it looks so bare, but it looks like they are in there just for the time being. 

I feel compelled to go here again but only for drinks out on the patio. The inside looks like Mexico, the food wasn't very good, and the cafeteria/microwave issues pretty much summed up this is not a place for a nice night out dining.

I also find it interesting how many reviews are by orange heads or people who were here for the ""vip opening."" c'mon, try the place before you write a public review of it, and by try I mean eat some food, and actually experience it.",negative,en
5,"Love me some hidden house! 

The music is too loud. The drinks too cheap. The clientele too local. But I've never had anything but a good time there. Whether it's karaoke or weird shit on the weekends you'll have fun if you don't expect it to be Merc, cuz Merc it ain't. And not for one moment in it's life has it pretended to be. But I love it for what it is and that's an experience.",positive,en
3,"I came in  on an early Friday morning to buy a dozen and a half of donuts for my co- workers. The man behind the counter found it odd I order such an amountapparently, by the way he repeated my order. In my case 1 dozen would have been too little, 2 dozen too many and I didn't want to waste any. That alrady made me feel uncomfortable. Just fulfill whatever order you get, I am customer. It was my first time here, after many, many drive by's. He asked me what flavors and suggested to make a mix, I didn't have a preference, as I just liked an assortment. Again I was frowned upon. Just give me your bestselling flavors...what's the problem. Well, I guess it was once and never again. The donuts were fresh tasting, but the service was far beyond friendly. To bad, you could have earned a new customer.",neutral,en
4,"It's rare that I have a date with my husband on a Monday afternoon/evening, but this past Memorial Day, we did just that.  After a quick visit to the Science Center (the Van Gogh alive exhibit is a must-see by the way), we were hungry so we headed over to Rice Paper.  Neither of us had ever been before, and we were pleased with our experience.

It was a tad bit too hot to sit outside, although they do have a covered patio with misters.  We walked in and were seated and greeted promptly by Al, our server.  He's quite the character.  He made us laugh quite a bit in addition to being attentive and making some recommendations.  We enjoyed the stylish renovated house / hip colorful atmosphere as well.

We ended up ordering a few things and sharing.  Highlights included the firecracker shrimp. a spider roll, a shrimp roll, and a zen salad.  Everything was light and tasted fresh.  We really enjoyed the dipping sauces that came with the spring rolls.  They've got such a huge selection of the spring rolls, that I can't wait to return to try some of the others.  They don't have a huge selection of Vietnamese entrees, but it appears that they will custom create a bit upon request.

I highly recommend going for the ""food happy hour.""  It's from 3pm - 6:30pm and includes $6 appetizers & $1 off all spring rolls.  Such a deal!  We didn't take advantage of it, but the ""drinks happy hour"" is actually 11am - 6:30pm and specialty drinks are $6, house wine by the glass is $5, well drinks are $4, and draft beer is just $2.75.

If only Rice Paper was a tad bit closer to home, I could see myself being a regular... Instead, I'll keep it high on my list of spots to return to when I find myself heading downtown!",positive,en
5,"I had a tough time deciding between 4 and 5 stars.  Wish there was 4.5 stars available for me to choose.

Went here on a business trip with a coworker and tried it out. I had at least one of the following:
Sapporo - Can it ever be bad?  It was served very cold.  Thumbs up.
Green Tea - Good.  Good service on the refills also.
Edamame - Good.  Right amount of salt.
Miso - Interesting wooden bowl and wooden spoon.  It tasted good, tho.
Yellow Tail, Salmon, Tuna, Albacore, Uni, FW Eel,  Kampachi nigiri.  Good stuff on all of those.  They also have ""Yasu style"" nigiri for some types, and they are good.  It usually involves ponzu on top.
Spicy Tuna and Softshell Crab roll.  SSC was great!

Service was pretty good and sushi was also good.  The bar was full but I wish I could have eaten there.  The sushi chefs were friendly and talkative to the people at the bar, which is unusual (at least compared to LA).  The base quality of the fish, outside of whatever ponzu, soy, wasabi and other ingredients were on it, was pretty good, but I wouldn't say 5 stars.  Since I generally judge a place wholly on the food, I give it 4.5.  Failing that, I rounded up!",positive,en
2,"Got a recommendation to eat here from a friend and was somewhat disappointed. Expecting a sit-down restaurant with wait service, I was surprised to find it layed out more like a fast food joint with the addition of a bar--kind of odd. The service was fast and friendly, but the food was average and didn't seem quite warm enough and got cold very fast as a result. The best part about dining here was the churro I picked up on my way out, which was surprisingly delicious. All in all, I don't see myself returning to the Blue Burrito Grille unless it's to pick up a churro or two after seeing a movie at the nearby theater.",negative,en
2,"Was a bit dissapointed after reading reviews here! I had the fijitas, wife had tacos. Didnt think the inferno  (green hatch chili)was all that hot!!!
The Taco meat was not spiced bland. Best part of the meal was the bean dip and chips even the salsa was nothing great!!! At least the beer was cold   ut at 13.00 a pitcher it better be!!!",negative,en
3,"ok....first let me say that I grew up in PHX. And we used to go for special occasions to ""Bobby MaGees"" which is where BobbyQ's is now located (says something about the quality of my restaurant experiences as a young fella)...And as cheesy as Bobby McGaees was...i kind of miss the pirate serving me my dinner (and the salad bar in the bathtub).

But i do like what they have done to the place. Cool interior. Casual but with a nice upscale feel. The patio seemed really nice (didn't sit out here).

We tried a variety of things. A burger, a pulled pork sandwich, brisket, baby backs etc...

I think the standout were the ribs. VERY good...very tender (but not overcooked), good sauce.  I enjoyed every one.Everything else was just ok. Like on par with Chili's (which isn't saying much). 

The sides were pretty tasty. Corn (roasted and then taken off the cob for you) , mashed potatoes, cornbread...all pretty good. 

Dinner for 4 (2 kids, no booze)...50$.

But a 5 star place? Maybe in the context of other restaurants in the Dunlap and I-17 areas (next to crazy Mitch's Furniture barn.) But not in the broader context of PHX.

I would definitely go back for ribs...but not a place that will go into the normal rotation.

Side note: Hilarious crowd on a Saturday night. Lots of ""west side"" clubbers...or maybe too old to be clubbers but want to go clubbing (there is a lounge attached).",neutral,en
4,"We went over for dinner- had the spring rolls, chicken curry, and lemongrass chicken. The spring rolls and lemongrass chicken were about a 3 star, but the chicken curry was really good and made up for the others. We also had the coconut water, which was fresh. Prices were reasonable we paid around $30.",positive,en
5,This place is great for a big group of people. We originally thought we were going to have 6 people. We ended up having 11 by the time everyone showed up. The staff was more than happy to accommodate us. The Kota Athenian chicken is very good. The price range is moderate. All in all a fantastic place.,positive,en
2,"Wow, servers were a bunch of stuck up b's in corset's... that's original. Didn't eat, but wanted to check out the crowd on a Friday night.  Bleh... typical NoSco crowd of gym jockeys in Affliction shirts two sizes too small... late 40's women with enough botox to look early 40's and a few lost 20 somethings stretching to pay $12 for a drink.  The cover band made it an easy decision to bail and salvage the night at Eddy V's with some great oysters and live jazz from actual musicians.",negative,en
5,"Whenever I'm looking for a quick healthy lunch, and am tired of salads from the grocery store, I swing by Zoe's Kitchen on Camelback. For a long time I used to get the spinach and chicken quesadillas, however last time I went in, I realized they didn't have them on the menu anymore. The manager that was on duty was super friendly and helpful, and explained it was now basically the spinach roll-ups (add chicken). I must say, they are even more delicious!

Is it your cheapest lunch option? Probably not. I'm a frugal person by nature, but it definitely beats eating Fast Food. So it's worth the extra buck or two to know you're not loading yourself up with tons of grease and carbs. I've introduced a lot of my coworkers to Zoe's and they all love it too. Now if only they can open up in Gilbert or Chandler near where I live!",positive,en
3,"I know I might some flack for only giving this place 3 stars, but really....it's no different than Chang's.  If I could give half stars, I would give it a 3.5.  Why?  Because I think it's better than Chang's.  It's exactly the same menu (just not as diverse), but cheaper.  If you are at this location, try Tott's instead.  I bet you'll start going there more often than here.",neutral,en
5,"Welcome to Downtown!  Finally a little area with a few great chains.  They also have PARKING!  The parking is located on the east or south side of the building.  We grabbed Jersey Mike's on a Sunday afternoon and took it home to eat.  They are the best subs we have had.  They are packed with meat and cheese.  Might be little pricier then blimpie, but with it due to the over load of meat!
 Check out a Jersey Mike's near you!",positive,en

3,I ordered a thin crust pizza for carry out from this location.  The staff was very friendly and the pizza was pretty good.  I look forward to trying their pasta in the near future.,neutral,en
4,"Went here for dinner tonight.  Service was great.  They still bring out the plate of pickles, but now they also brought slices of challah bread and rolls (the onion one is awesome).

I had the Vegetarian Delight Sandwich.  Very tasty.  The vegetable cream cheese on the sandwich was excellent.  Huge portions.  The tomato soup was good as well, but not as good as the soup at Bravi.

I tasted some of the onion strings.  Delicious.  They had a dipping sauce that was a bit spicy.  It was good too.

My husband got Aaron's Choice - some kind of pastrami/corned beef sandwich.  He liked it, but prefers Miracle Mile.  

Overall a good dining experience, and I got some bagels to go!",positive,en
